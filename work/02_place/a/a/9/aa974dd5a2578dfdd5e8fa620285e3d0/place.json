We had our first meal here recently and were very happy with the lunch served at this promising new restaurant. Opening hours are 11.30am to 10.30pm. \n\nSeating is urban, tidy with modest South Asian wall decor. Staff are friendly, helpful with describing the menu and worked hard to serve us a nice meal. \n\nDuring our lunch we tried their signature Cardamon roasted chicken. This was two pieces of chicken with a nice cardamon infused yoghurt sauce, served with cumin rice, dal, a few paratha and light salad. The chicken was tender, succulent and tasted very good with the special sauce.The sides were equally very good. \n\nEven more impressive was the lamb quinoa biryani. This was an excellent dish, the lamb was delicious and the quinoa seasoned nicely with a light spice, making for a most flavourful serving, one we will eagerly return to reorder. \n\nFor dessert we enjoyed the payasam, a nicely flavoured rice pudding. We also tried the traditional paan, which was expectedly strongly flavoured bites wrapped in betel leaf. In short, we liked both but would probably stick with the payasam next time as we usually prefer more subtle desserts after well-flavoured mains. Quick last note that the mango lassi ordered was better than expected as well. \n\nIn the end, quite impressed with our first meal at Cardamon. This is a neat place to try for those seeking South Asian cuisine and looking for something different than traditional tandoori and curry houses.",

We had our first meal here recently and were very happy with the lunch served at this promising new restaurant. Opening hours are 11.30am to 10.30pm. \n\nSeating is urban, tidy with modest South Asian wall decor. Staff are friendly, helpful with describing the menu and worked hard to serve us a nice meal. \n\nDuring our lunch we tried their signature Cardamon roasted chicken. This was two pieces of chicken with a nice cardamon infused yoghurt sauce, served with cumin rice, dal, a few paratha and light salad. The chicken was tender, succulent and tasted very good with the special sauce.The sides were equally very good. \n\nEven more impressive was the lamb quinoa biryani. This was an excellent dish, the lamb was delicious and the quinoa seasoned nicely with a light spice, making for a most flavourful serving, one we will eagerly return to reorder. \n\nFor dessert we enjoyed the payasam, a nicely flavoured rice pudding. We also tried the traditional paan, which was expectedly strongly flavoured bites wrapped in betel leaf. In short, we liked both but would probably stick with the payasam next time as we usually prefer more subtle desserts after well-flavoured mains. Quick last note that the mango lassi ordered was better than expected as well. \n\nIn the end, quite impressed with our first meal at Cardamon. This is a neat place to try for those seeking South Asian cuisine and looking for something different than traditional tandoori and curry houses.",
