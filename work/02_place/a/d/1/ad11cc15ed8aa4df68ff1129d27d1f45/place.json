We arrived at 12 noon and all 7 of us had the restaurant to ourselves, which was quite nice.\n\nMost of us ordered the cheeseburger. I personally got the fish burger with the chocolate milkshake upgrade. All of this arrived fairly quickly with friendly service, though we would\u2019ve appreciated some music during the wait.\n\nRegarding the food itself: although I thoroughly enjoyed the milkshake (always my fave at Burger Joys), I was a bit disappointed by the burger and the fries. It seemed like the fish fillet and fries had been left in the fryer for a little too long, leaving parts of it tough to bite. It was still delicious but the experience wasn\u2019t as great as my previous visits.\n\nIn total, I spent $120 ($89 for fish burger set + $31 for milkshake drink upgrade). Pretty steep for lunch, especially considering the quality I got. I think the cheeseburger would\u2019ve been a better choice.",

Instead of simply giving you some fries with a truffle salad dressing for dipping, truffle fries here are actually fries fried with truffle.\n\nThe buffalo wings are perhaps a bit too salty for my taste.

          "text": "Burger Joys Sai Ying Pun is spartan and bare-bones: three to four countertops with backless bar stools - and when my boyfriend and visited on a Sunday at 8:00, there were only two staff: one manning the grill and the other taking orders. \n\nThe menu offers a handful of fry-options: sweet potato, an In-n-Out reminiscent animal-fries option, cheese fries. The Southern fried chicken bites were crisp and bite-sized, perfect crabs of batter encompassing juicy and tender nuggets of meat. The classic cheeseburger (at 108HKD), came with a solid-tasting brioche bun, juicy interior, and deliciously oozy melty American cheese. You can add your bougie cheeses, but no one can deny that a good square of yellow American has just the right amount of fat and salt to go perfectly with a medium-rare patty. \n\nBut what I love about Burger Joy\u2019s burger is that the fresh ingredients are snappy and fresh - lettuce is springy, tomatoes are bright and crunchy, and the red onion! Oh the red onion- sharpness cutting through meat. \n\nBurger Joys is great for a casual no-frills meal - not date-worthy, but plenty perfect for when you don\u2019t need to impress: juice running down your arm and used napkins all over the tray.",

We arrived at 12 noon and all 7 of us had the restaurant to ourselves, which was quite nice.\n\nMost of us ordered the cheeseburger. I personally got the fish burger with the chocolate milkshake upgrade. All of this arrived fairly quickly with friendly service, though we would\u2019ve appreciated some music during the wait.\n\nRegarding the food itself: although I thoroughly enjoyed the milkshake (always my fave at Burger Joys), I was a bit disappointed by the burger and the fries. It seemed like the fish fillet and fries had been left in the fryer for a little too long, leaving parts of it tough to bite. It was still delicious but the experience wasn\u2019t as great as my previous visits.\n\nIn total, I spent $120 ($89 for fish burger set + $31 for milkshake drink upgrade). Pretty steep for lunch, especially considering the quality I got. I think the cheeseburger would\u2019ve been a better choice.",

The pickle is just right and not too sour.\n\nThe truffle fries something that's out of my expectation. Instead of simply giving you some fries with a truffle salad dressing for dipping, truffle fries here are actually fries fried with truffle.\n\nThe buffalo wings are perhaps a bit too salty for my taste.
