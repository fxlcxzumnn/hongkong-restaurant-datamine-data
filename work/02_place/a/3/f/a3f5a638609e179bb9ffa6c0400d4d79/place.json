          "text": "Interesting.  I just googled etiquette at JAPANESE restaurants to make sure my expectations were valid.  I was curious why I sat for at least 30 min after finishing dinner without being checked on, asked if I would care for anything else, etc.  When I was first seated, the server was very friendly, even brought me a sample of saki to see if I liked it.  But I never saw her again.  There were 3 or 4 other people who brought the food, refilled tea, and removed the plates.  I was intending to order sorbet and an after dinner drink, but no one ever returned.  There were very few customers, only 3 besides myself, and at least 4 employees walking or standing around.  After 30 minutes of sipping on my drink, I finally got up to ask for my check. I was really disappointed.  The food I ordered all came ala carte, not by choice, but rice wasn\u2019t \nserved with a meal, and if I ordered tofu, it was served alone...  so I had to order vegetables separately.   I had to order 3 separate things to complete a meal that is very common in all other restaurants. The food was very plain, not at all like JAPANESE restaurants I frequent in Washington DC, Los Angeles and New York.  \nI asked for teriyaki on the side and the portion was appx 1 tablespoon!  I had to ask for a second side of it, and again, it was a spoon full!  Kind of funny since I had 2 entrees AND rice. I would have not even bothered to write this review, but I googled the restaurant to see if there was something I was missing, and I saw all these positive reviews, so I am really confused!  \nThe atmosphere was very nice..., the table, lighting, view, etc etc. But I am astounded I paid $40 USD for tasteless tofu, vegetables and a side of rice, without any regard to checking if I would like anything else, at the very least, come to the table to leave my check. I am not exaggerating I sat for 30 min, thinking my server would return. I was seated facing toward the window, my back to the restaurant, so I could not make eye contact without completely turning around in my chair.  I could see the reflections of the employees in the window glass, so I knew they were there.  I stay in SPG hotels often, around the world, but this is my first time to Hong Kong. Can anyone shed light on my experience? Thank you!",

          "text": "Interesting.  I just googled etiquette at JAPANESE restaurants to make sure my expectations were valid.  I was curious why I sat for at least 30 min after finishing dinner without being checked on, asked if I would care for anything else, etc.  When I was first seated, the server was very friendly, even brought me a sample of saki to see if I liked it.  But I never saw her again.  There were 3 or 4 other people who brought the food, refilled tea, and removed the plates.  I was intending to order sorbet and an after dinner drink, but no one ever returned.  There were very few customers, only 3 besides myself, and at least 4 employees walking or standing around.  After 30 minutes of sipping on my drink, I finally got up to ask for my check. I was really disappointed.  The food I ordered all came ala carte, not by choice, but rice wasn\u2019t \nserved with a meal, and if I ordered tofu, it was served alone...  so I had to order vegetables separately.   I had to order 3 separate things to complete a meal that is very common in all other restaurants. The food was very plain, not at all like JAPANESE restaurants I frequent in Washington DC, Los Angeles and New York.  \nI asked for teriyaki on the side and the portion was appx 1 tablespoon!  I had to ask for a second side of it, and again, it was a spoon full!  Kind of funny since I had 2 entrees AND rice. I would have not even bothered to write this review, but I googled the restaurant to see if there was something I was missing, and I saw all these positive reviews, so I am really confused!  \nThe atmosphere was very nice..., the table, lighting, view, etc etc. But I am astounded I paid $40 USD for tasteless tofu, vegetables and a side of rice, without any regard to checking if I would like anything else, at the very least, come to the table to leave my check. I am not exaggerating I sat for 30 min, thinking my server would return. I was seated facing toward the window, my back to the restaurant, so I could not make eye contact without completely turning around in my chair.  I could see the reflections of the employees in the window glass, so I knew they were there.  I stay in SPG hotels often, around the world, but this is my first time to Hong Kong. Can anyone shed light on my experience? Thank you!",
