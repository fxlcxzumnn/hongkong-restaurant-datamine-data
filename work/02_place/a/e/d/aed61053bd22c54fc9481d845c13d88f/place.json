          "text": "I went with my friend for the Iftar during Ramadan. We were hoping that there was going to be a special Iftar menu for this holy month, but unfortunately we were disappointed in regards to that matter. We were okay with that, and decided to order a set for 2 people. The food was absolutely disgusting, by that I mean almost nothing was seasoned properly (Lamb and chicken Tagines). The taste was definitely not Moroccan, nothing presented to us was worth to be called a Moroccan dish. The place is called: Casablanca Caf\u00e9 and Restaurant, I thought that there was going to be a Moroccan touch to the food but my friend and I were extremely disappointed. As a Moroccan, I didn't see anything Moroccan about the food. Allow me to go into details, so the first thing we had was the Greek salad. I mean a salad is probably the easiest thing that you could ever prepare, but we were in total shock as soon as the dish was served. There was only lettuce, a few olives and some cheese at the top. They don't even have tomatoes, cucumbers or onions, which I believe are the basic ingredients to have a proper Greek Salad. And not only it was not complete but the taste was absolutely terrible, it tasted like it was prepared ages ago. Moving to the harira, I have never seen in my whole life a Moroccan harira with small meatballs. It didn't taste like a harira at all, they should have just called it a tomato soup with meatballs. In regards to the Chicken Tagine, it was definitely the worst tagine I have ever had during all my life. It was absolutely bland and tasteless. It was like you were having water with chicken. It was not seasoned at all, even the chicken was tasteless. And finally, the desserts were all Middle eastern, nothing was Moroccan, and I am still asking myself why would they call that a Moroccan restaurant. We had baklawa, and again my dear readers, it tasted like it was prepared 1000 years ago. Nothing, absolutely nothing was fresh. I am really surprised how people would give this so called restaurant more than 1 star, if I had the chance to give it a 0 star I would have done so. And this is without talking about the prices that were expensive in regards to the quality of the dishes we had. To sum up, it was a terrible experience, I would never step a foot in that restaurant again and I do not suggest it to anyone who wants to try the Moroccan cuisine.",

We were hoping that there was going to be a special Iftar menu for this holy month, but unfortunately we were disappointed in regards to that matter. We were okay with that, and decided to order a set for 2 people. The food was absolutely disgusting, by that I mean almost nothing was seasoned properly (Lamb and chicken Tagines). The taste was definitely not Moroccan, nothing presented to us was worth to be called a Moroccan dish. The place is called: Casablanca Caf\u00e9 and Restaurant, I thought that there was going to be a Moroccan touch to the food but my friend and I were extremely disappointed. As a Moroccan, I didn't see anything Moroccan about the food. Allow me to go into details, so the first thing we had was the Greek salad. I mean a salad is probably the easiest thing that you could ever prepare, but we were in total shock as soon as the dish was served. There was only lettuce, a few olives and some cheese at the top. They don't even have tomatoes, cucumbers or onions, which I believe are the basic ingredients to have a proper Greek Salad. And not only it was not complete but the taste was absolutely terrible, it tasted like it was prepared ages ago. Moving to the harira, I have never seen in my whole life a Moroccan harira with small meatballs. It didn't taste like a harira at all, they should have just called it a tomato soup with meatballs. In regards to the Chicken Tagine, it was definitely the worst tagine I have ever had during all my life. It was absolutely bland and tasteless. It was like you were having water with chicken. It was not seasoned at all, even the chicken was tasteless. And finally, the desserts were all Middle eastern, nothing was Moroccan, and I am still asking myself why would they call that a Moroccan restaurant. We had baklawa, and again my dear readers, it tasted like it was prepared 1000 years ago. Nothing, absolutely nothing was fresh. I am really surprised how people would give this so called restaurant more than 1 star, if I had the chance to give it a 0 star I would have done so. And this is without talking about the prices that were expensive in regards to the quality of the dishes we had. To sum up, it was a terrible experience, I would never step a foot in that restaurant again and I do not suggest it to anyone who wants to try the Moroccan cuisine.",
