Their service was very slow. Each dish came in with long time in between. The very odd thing was that you have to inform them to start cook your rice balls as they consider them as desert. Who knew about this strange rule, so we waited for a long time and no waiter/waitress even bothered to ask! After we asked for them, they serviced one bowl, and then even forgot the other one! I cannot believe it. If not for their relatively good steam buns, I'd give them even one star or zero rating if available. So be very careful to go to this restaurant.",

          "text": "We went to this restaurant on 6/30/2019 Sunday. Food was good, but service was very bad. We ordered steamed buns, some veg dish and two bowls of rice balls. Their service was very slow. Each dish came in with long time in between. The very odd thing was that you have to inform them to start cook your rice balls as they consider them as desert. Who knew about this strange rule, so we waited for a long time and no waiter/waitress even bothered to ask! After we asked for them, they serviced one bowl, and then even forgot the other one! I cannot believe it. If not for their relatively good steam buns, I'd give them even one star or zero rating if available. So be very careful to go to this restaurant.",
