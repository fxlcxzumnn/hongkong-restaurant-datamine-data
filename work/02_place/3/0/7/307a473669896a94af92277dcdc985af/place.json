I also suspect there is a thief at their laundry store.   I took my Ralph Polo jean there with other laundry but it came back as a cheap broken jean with holes mixed in a pile of laundry.  At the first the owner said he will handle the situation, and the second phone call he claim said that I have no prove.  I took the issue to district manager, she refer the issue back to the store owner.  I took the broken jean back to the store and they reply if no one return the lost jean to them, they can do nothing.  For being their customer for two years, I am surprise that they can just treat me as if I lost a laundry at their store but it is none of their business.  Do I have to take a photo of each laundry and count it in front of them before I trust them for their service?  Being a chain store has really no help to their service attitude because of the store are individually owned. For this  franchised brand, you cannot expect the same responsible and trustful service, don't bring what clothes to this store because they have cheaper service, because you will eventually pay more for their mistake in the long run.
