One area for improvement in the platter however would be no tomato, this isn\u2019t a British Breakfast, just include more of that beef or lamb skewer, which was incredibly tasty. The service leaves much to be improved and the main reason for the 3 star, it\u2019s IFC you expect a level of service, not to have to call the waiter over constantly, get delivered other peoples dishes by error, and only being offered the second round of your happy hour beer upon request after the bill is delivered and you are reminded by the odd inconsistencies in pricing on it.

You can access from the mall or the outdoor terrace. It offers nice view with great outdoor atmosphere (except it\u2019s too dark at night). It\u2019s a self-served restaurant meaning you have to go to the cashier and order the food yourself but the waitress will bring you the food so there\u2019s no service charge. I wasn\u2019t expecting much but turned out the food is quite good! I really love the fresh mango and beetroot rolls and the mushroom curry with roti. The curry is definitely tasty and just perfect with roti and rice. I didn\u2019t order much cause I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not gonna be authentic but I\u2019ll definitely come back and try out more. It\u2019s definitely a perfect place to hang out with friends with such a nice view and large table. I\u2019m taking one star off because the service is quite slow and it took a while to wait at the cashier and took another while to wait for the cashier to figure out how to actually use the system. The price is reasonable given the location.",

One area for improvement in the platter however would be no tomato, this isn\u2019t a British Breakfast, just include more of that beef or lamb skewer, which was incredibly tasty. The service leaves much to be improved and the main reason for the 3 star, it\u2019s IFC you expect a level of service, not to have to call the waiter over constantly, get delivered other peoples dishes by error, and only being offered the second round of your happy hour beer upon request after the bill is delivered and you are reminded by the odd inconsistencies in pricing on it.

You can access from the mall or the outdoor terrace. It offers nice view with great outdoor atmosphere (except it\u2019s too dark at night). It\u2019s a self-served restaurant meaning you have to go to the cashier and order the food yourself but the waitress will bring you the food so there\u2019s no service charge. I wasn\u2019t expecting much but turned out the food is quite good! I really love the fresh mango and beetroot rolls and the mushroom curry with roti. The curry is definitely tasty and just perfect with roti and rice. I didn\u2019t order much cause I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not gonna be authentic but I\u2019ll definitely come back and try out more. It\u2019s definitely a perfect place to hang out with friends with such a nice view and large table. I\u2019m taking one star off because the service is quite slow and it took a while to wait at the cashier and took another while to wait for the cashier to figure out how to actually use the system. The price is reasonable given the location.",
