Even though I was excited about my business trip to Hong Kong, and I was more worried about my food arrangements. So, as everyone does, I googled and land on Woodlands. I was surprised and wowed by their professional and traditional approach of cooking foods by considering the sanctity of every community. The food quality was as similar as I eat in India.

All of us were so enjoyable and love the food so much which we were served. Some may not know much about Indian food and may had misunderstood just taste \"curry alike\" to allcl indian dishes or just spicy. But you can enjoy a huge variety of heartfelt dishes which looks good and taste awesome. They can also serve vegan dishes so no worry about your stomach, as they have also selected quality ingredients. Some of us are 100% meat lovers but have thumbs up for the entire night\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18 and that may cause 100% change your impression to Indian food!! This is beyond Veggie \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\nHighly recommended to ask the staff of Woodlands for advises if you have really no ideas what should pick. I believe you will enjoy as much as I did! Must come more often to try other different dishes...with more people! This is the only way to taste more while can share\ud83d\ude01",

Even though I was excited about my business trip to Hong Kong, and I was more worried about my food arrangements. So, as everyone does, I googled and land on Woodlands. I was surprised and wowed by their professional and traditional approach of cooking foods by considering the sanctity of every community. The food quality was as similar as I eat in India. Great job Guys! All The Best!!",

I have always heard praises about Indian foods, so finally I decided to give it a go. I cannot believe how glad I am that I picked this place. The wait staff was so friendly and one of them suggested us something called Uttapam. It looked like a pizza but instead of refining flour it was prepared with organic and whole lentils, freshly cut veggies and other assorted spices.",

All of us were so enjoyable and love the food so much which we were served. Some may not know much about Indian food and may had misunderstood just taste \"curry alike\" to allcl indian dishes or just spicy. But you can enjoy a huge variety of heartfelt dishes which looks good and taste awesome. They can also serve vegan dishes so no worry about your stomach, as they have also selected quality ingredients. Some of us are 100% meat lovers but have thumbs up for the entire night\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18 and that may cause 100% change your impression to Indian food!! This is beyond Veggie \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\nHighly recommended to ask the staff of Woodlands for advises if you have really no ideas what should pick. I believe you will enjoy as much as I did! Must come more often to try other different dishes...with more people! This is the only way to taste more while can share\ud83d\ude01",
