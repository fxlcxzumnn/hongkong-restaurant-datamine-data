I reminded her that Belvedere is a vodka, not a gin.  The person in charge, came over and said that that, Belvedere it's a premium vodka,  they charge extra for it. I told the person in charge that the waitress said it was no change in the price if I ordered Belvedere, and I didn't even receive the vodka that I ordered.  She took the $10 off the tab and apologise. But I was very upset that I ordered a certain vodka at a price that I was told I was going to get, didn't get it and didn't get the vodka I ordered. I had to argue with the staff to get the price changed and remind them what liquor Belvedere was. At the end they were very apologetic and very courteous to me. On a positive note, I love they use last straw, straws. Paper straws are great to see at a bar. And I'm happy to see them fundraising for a charity, just some information about it would be great.",
