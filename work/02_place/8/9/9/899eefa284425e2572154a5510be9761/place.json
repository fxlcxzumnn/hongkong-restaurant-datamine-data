The Grilled pineapple and some sprinkled pomegranate seeds were a nice touch.\n\nThe Corned Beef & Guacamole Tortilla Wraps.....well, corned beef is always a safe bet so you can never go wrong with this one.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffbIt is definitely worth trying.\nMG Cafe is the first place I ate at, after my office move to Kwun Tong ..... so I consider it my gateway to this new work area.",

It seemed to me that they had pan fried a big lot of sausages and bacons and wouldn\u2019t care to reheat them when they were to be served.  I asked for a hot dish and returned that cold pathetic dish to them.  They just microwaved it and it came out lukewarm.  Fresh fruits set out on the menu as part of the breakfast actually meant 5 or 6 tiny seeds of pomegranates.  Ingredients not bad but pathetically cooked and served. Service was below standard too. $150 is a total rip-off given the quality of food and service.",

The Grilled pineapple and some sprinkled pomegranate seeds were a nice touch.\n\nThe Corned Beef & Guacamole Tortilla Wraps.....well, corned beef is always a safe bet so you can never go wrong with this one.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffbIt is definitely worth trying.\nMG Cafe is the first place I ate at, after my office move to Kwun Tong ..... so I consider it my gateway to this new work area.",

It seemed to me that they had pan fried a big lot of sausages and bacons and wouldn\u2019t care to reheat them when they were to be served.  I asked for a hot dish and returned that cold pathetic dish to them.  They just microwaved it and it came out lukewarm.  Fresh fruits set out on the menu as part of the breakfast actually meant 5 or 6 tiny seeds of pomegranates.  Ingredients not bad but pathetically cooked and served. Service was below standard too. $150 is a total rip-off given the quality of food and service.",
