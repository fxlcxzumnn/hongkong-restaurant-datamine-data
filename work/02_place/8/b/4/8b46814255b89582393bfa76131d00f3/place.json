          "text": "Bib n Hops is often packed with expats during happy hours. The vibes look good, which attracted me to try it out.\n\nBib n Hops is a modern Korean restaurant with a menu which could satisfy you with one food or another, from burger to bibimbap to Korean fried chicken. It did take me some time to figure out whether I want a burger or fried chicken. I ended up ordering a Sizzling Cheese Fried Chicken to pamper myself after a whole week of hard work.\n\nThe Sizzling Cheese Fried Chicken was not quite what I expected. The salsa and coriander on top weren\u2019t really my thing, so I took some time getting rid of them\u2026\n\nI expected more cheese for such dish. However, there were only a bit of molten cheese hidden in the bottom of the pot, which was quite difficult to mix with the fried chicken. Also, once the pot cooled down, the molten cheese solidified again, which made it even more difficult to eat. I wish I had molten cheese poured on top of the fried chicken.\n\nThe fried chicken itself tasted good though. Fried skin was crispy but not too oily, and the meat was quite tender indeed. Yet, the fried skin got caught by the solidified cheese after some time, so it\u2019s like racing against time to eat this dish\u2026\n\nThe portion is generous. There are 6 or 7 large pieces of fried chicken in the pot. A bit too much for a solo diner like me, but would be great to share among friends.",

The vibes look good, which attracted me to try it out.\n\nBib n Hops is a modern Korean restaurant with a menu which could satisfy you with one food or another, from burger to bibimbap to Korean fried chicken. It did take me some time to figure out whether I want a burger or fried chicken. I ended up ordering a Sizzling Cheese Fried Chicken to pamper myself after a whole week of hard work.\n\nThe Sizzling Cheese Fried Chicken was not quite what I expected. The salsa and coriander on top weren\u2019t really my thing, so I took some time getting rid of them\u2026\n\nI expected more cheese for such dish. However, there were only a bit of molten cheese hidden in the bottom of the pot, which was quite difficult to mix with the fried chicken. Also, once the pot cooled down, the molten cheese solidified again, which made it even more difficult to eat. I wish I had molten cheese poured on top of the fried chicken.\n\nThe fried chicken itself tasted good though. Fried skin was crispy but not too oily, and the meat was quite tender indeed. Yet, the fried skin got caught by the solidified cheese after some time, so it\u2019s like racing against time to eat this dish\u2026\n\nThe portion is generous. There are 6 or 7 large pieces of fried chicken in the pot. A bit too much for a solo diner like me, but would be great to share among friends.",
