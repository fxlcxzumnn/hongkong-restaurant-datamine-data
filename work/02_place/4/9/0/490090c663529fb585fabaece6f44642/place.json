The Falstaff try their best to go into the kitchen and probably the stuff inside but nothing worked an hour later they finally say that everything has sold out! They should have tell the customer by the way when we order the food instead of keep on chasing them.",

The nicest parts of this restaurant\uff1a you never need a reservation, it's close by for Western district dwellers who do not feel like schlepping all the way to Saikung or Stanley for a seafood dinner, and the average cost (if you go for sets) tend to hover around 500HKD a person, which is really reasonable for fresh seafood in HK. The restaurant is also brightly lit and has enormous space for a HK eating establishment, so a decent space for large group gatherings. As other reviewers have noted, the staff may not be incredibly communicative and you should probably be quite vigilent in monitoring your server and see that your order comes correctly. Sometimes they may forget part of your order or leave your seafood steaming for too long, so speak up if you think something isn't right. Some family members have complained that this place overcooks seafood (tiny lobsters steamed for 5min straight tend to be a bit rubbery), but I love overcooked seafood and the chewiness that comes with it, so I like this place just fine.",

The Falstaff try their best to go into the kitchen and probably the stuff inside but nothing worked an hour later they finally say that everything has sold out! They should have tell the customer by the way when we order the food instead of keep on chasing them.",
