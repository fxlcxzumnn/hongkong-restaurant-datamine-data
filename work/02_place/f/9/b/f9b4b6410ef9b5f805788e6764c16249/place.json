We talked to the waiter there and expressed that we come earlier, the waiter just said he will check and walked away.  After several minutes, we asked another waiter for the same thing, he just looked at his watch and ask us to wait.  It gave me an impression that he was thinking \u201cYour reservation is 6:30pm, why you come so early?\u201d, which made us start feeling unpleasant.  Then the waiters and other several waiters and manager just gather around the counter looking at the workstations but doing nothing at all.  At last we asked the manger the same question, and again, he just told us to wait.  Up to this moment, NOT ONE there could give me an actual answer or offer us a seat, so I finally lost may patience and told the manager and waiters that they don\u2019t need to bother anymore, I will eat somewhere else.\n\nI was not aware that the dinner serving time there was starting from 6:30pm, but the staff there could told me that and offer me to sit down first, instead of just leaving us standing there like a fool and didn\u2019t know what was happening. \n\nI am very disappointed of receiving such bad service at such a legendary Five-Star hotel.",

The sandwiches bread doesn't taste good at all probably it's because they were store in fridge before and obviously the breads are all wet and soggy.  The mini bagel is disappointing as well.   The scone is okay.  There is nothing special with the desserts and the macaroon is not soft enough.  The only good side about this afternoon tea is you get a set of Harry Winston spoons which are quite special.  I tried the peninsula blend tea which is good and service is good.",

Moreover, when the dishes arrived , one time it\u2019s served from the right hand side then from the left hand side for the next dish then..... \nIs it really a most historical classic 5 or even 6 stars hotel in Hong Kong ?",

Perhaps it was the time of the day / stress from the holiday season. However, our server mixed up our Orange Pekoe and Early Grey order, a little peculiar considering this place probably sells just as much tea as Lipton.\n\nFood was under average. The Caesar dressing tasted like a watered down mix of mayo from a jar with some lemon juice. The lettuce was clean and crisp though.\n\nPro-tip: if you are going with a baby or toddler, bring your own booster. Their highchair's safety belt was so pungent (probably from other kids chewing on it and leaving it in storage to incubate), we ended up holding our daughter the whole meal.\n\nWe'll come back to Peninsula again, but probably not to the Lobby for a \"real\" meal. Their tea is still great despite the little mix up.",

We talked to the waiter there and expressed that we come earlier, the waiter just said he will check and walked away.  After several minutes, we asked another waiter for the same thing, he just looked at his watch and ask us to wait.  It gave me an impression that he was thinking \u201cYour reservation is 6:30pm, why you come so early?\u201d, which made us start feeling unpleasant.  Then the waiters and other several waiters and manager just gather around the counter looking at the workstations but doing nothing at all.  At last we asked the manger the same question, and again, he just told us to wait.  Up to this moment, NOT ONE there could give me an actual answer or offer us a seat, so I finally lost may patience and told the manager and waiters that they don\u2019t need to bother anymore, I will eat somewhere else.\n\nI was not aware that the dinner serving time there was starting from 6:30pm, but the staff there could told me that and offer me to sit down first, instead of just leaving us standing there like a fool and didn\u2019t know what was happening. \n\nI am very disappointed of receiving such bad service at such a legendary Five-Star hotel.",

The sandwiches bread doesn't taste good at all probably it's because they were store in fridge before and obviously the breads are all wet and soggy.  The mini bagel is disappointing as well.   The scone is okay.  There is nothing special with the desserts and the macaroon is not soft enough.  The only good side about this afternoon tea is you get a set of Harry Winston spoons which are quite special.  I tried the peninsula blend tea which is good and service is good.",
