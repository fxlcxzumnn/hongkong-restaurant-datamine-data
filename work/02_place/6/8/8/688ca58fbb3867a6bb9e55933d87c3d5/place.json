The price of the buffet lunch is $598 +10% service charge and we are fortunate to get your hotel's $1500 cash voucher, so we first set foot on Ritz Carlton's Cafe103. I really can't imagine that there were so many food styles for the buffet lunch. The seafood also provided lobster and oysters, and it was also very fresh. There was no selection of low-quality ingredients for this prestigious hotel. The quality of oysters is also comparable to the taste of we had in Australia! In addition, there are many styles of hot plates, and there are all kinds of international cuisine! The number of desserts is also very refined. We have compared the sweet quality of Ritz Carlton and other hotels, and Ritz Carlton is even better! Therefore, we feel that even this lunch is expensive, but we are impressed by the food, the waiter's attentive service attitude, the constant addition of water to us, and the change of dishes. Of course, it is worth mentioning that this Victoria Harbour landscape is really unforgettable and unforgettable! At last I would like to thanks Ritz Carlton HK for giving me and my friends a very important memory of life!",

There was a good variety of seafood, including sushi stand, but also more traditional Chinese dishes, like bbq duck, pork belly and mapo tofu. Spectacular views of Hong Kong make this experience pretty special.",

The seating area is quite nice and serene enough for you to take in the amazing views offered from the 103rd floor overlooking Victoria Harbour. Food selection is debatable. Although quality was definitely on par, variety needs improvement for the lunch buffet. Prices are what you would expect from hotel buffets in the city center. All in all, the overall experience was good.",

The price of the buffet lunch is $598 +10% service charge and we are fortunate to get your hotel's $1500 cash voucher, so we first set foot on Ritz Carlton's Cafe103. I really can't imagine that there were so many food styles for the buffet lunch. The seafood also provided lobster and oysters, and it was also very fresh. There was no selection of low-quality ingredients for this prestigious hotel. The quality of oysters is also comparable to the taste of we had in Australia! In addition, there are many styles of hot plates, and there are all kinds of international cuisine! The number of desserts is also very refined. We have compared the sweet quality of Ritz Carlton and other hotels, and Ritz Carlton is even better! Therefore, we feel that even this lunch is expensive, but we are impressed by the food, the waiter's attentive service attitude, the constant addition of water to us, and the change of dishes. Of course, it is worth mentioning that this Victoria Harbour landscape is really unforgettable and unforgettable! At last I would like to thanks Ritz Carlton HK for giving me and my friends a very important memory of life!",
