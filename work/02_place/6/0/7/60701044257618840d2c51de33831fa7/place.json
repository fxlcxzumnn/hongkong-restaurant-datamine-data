          "text": "Asiri is a homey Japanese cafe/restaurant in Quarry Bay run by Japaneses. I was told more than once that if you want to see how good a Japanese restaurant is in Hong Kong, take a look at how many Japanese customers are dining there. If there are some Japanese customers in the restaurant, it means that the restaurant is doing a great job and is serving authentic Japanese cuisines that even the local would go for it. Asiri is definitely a good one, as I can see quite a number of Japanese families dining there during my visit, probably also because Quarry Bay is a popular district for Japanese in Hong Kong.\n\nThe soup curry set came with a nice potato salad as starter. The potato mash was so delicious with diced egg inside. The salad dressing was great to make the veggies more acceptable to veggies haters like me. The whole salad was quite filling indeed.\n\nI came for this signature soup curry which comes from Hokkaido, Japan. A friendly waitress taught me how to enjoy soup curry best. It\u2019s actually like a rice version of tsukemen. You use a spoon to scoop up some rice, and dip the rice in the soup curry to eat it.\n\nThe soup curry was very delicious! Its texture and taste is thinner than ordinary Japanese curry, yet it\u2019s a novel dining experience. A bottle of spice powder was provided if you want to top up the spiciness of the soup curry. I did try some of it and it was good.\n\nThe grilled veggies picked up the curry flavour from the soup. Yum! What\u2019s best, there was a whole chicken leg hidden under the veggies! The meat was tender and flavoured, unlike those dry ones found in Chinese soup. \n\nThe whole set was very filling and definitely worth the price. For HKD$108 you get a salad, the soup curry rice and a drink. What else can you ask for? I saw some other customers ordered some nice fried fish and stuff, I might as well try them next time.",

          "text": "Asiri is a homey Japanese cafe/restaurant in Quarry Bay run by Japaneses. I was told more than once that if you want to see how good a Japanese restaurant is in Hong Kong, take a look at how many Japanese customers are dining there. If there are some Japanese customers in the restaurant, it means that the restaurant is doing a great job and is serving authentic Japanese cuisines that even the local would go for it. Asiri is definitely a good one, as I can see quite a number of Japanese families dining there during my visit, probably also because Quarry Bay is a popular district for Japanese in Hong Kong.\n\nThe soup curry set came with a nice potato salad as starter. The potato mash was so delicious with diced egg inside. The salad dressing was great to make the veggies more acceptable to veggies haters like me. The whole salad was quite filling indeed.\n\nI came for this signature soup curry which comes from Hokkaido, Japan. A friendly waitress taught me how to enjoy soup curry best. It\u2019s actually like a rice version of tsukemen. You use a spoon to scoop up some rice, and dip the rice in the soup curry to eat it.\n\nThe soup curry was very delicious! Its texture and taste is thinner than ordinary Japanese curry, yet it\u2019s a novel dining experience. A bottle of spice powder was provided if you want to top up the spiciness of the soup curry. I did try some of it and it was good.\n\nThe grilled veggies picked up the curry flavour from the soup. Yum! What\u2019s best, there was a whole chicken leg hidden under the veggies! The meat was tender and flavoured, unlike those dry ones found in Chinese soup. \n\nThe whole set was very filling and definitely worth the price. For HKD$108 you get a salad, the soup curry rice and a drink. What else can you ask for? I saw some other customers ordered some nice fried fish and stuff, I might as well try them next time.",
