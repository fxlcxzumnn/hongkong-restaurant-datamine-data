Instead, it was nightmare.\n\nThis Smrat is the Hung Hom branch of Smrat Restaurant in Chung King Mansion, Tsim Sha Tsui. Maybe due to the location they sold set lunches well into the afternoon tea period, and that's where my nightmare began. Initially I wanted to order a set meal of Baingan Bhartha (mashed eggplants) with plain rice, but at the insistance of the lady owner who insisted that Baingan Bhartha went well with naan bread and not rice or else she won't serve it (that's the impression I got from her), I reluctantly changed my choice to Veg Vindaloo (how often do you hear that, but I gave it a try anyway), with plain boiled basmati rice and a cup of Masala Tea. Honestly, the so-called Veg. Vindaloo is nothing more than a spicier-than-usual vegetable curry which tasted average at best. The boiled rice is piping hot and the Masala Tea is fairly spicy and hot. All or this could not offset the very poor customer service in a hostile dining atmosphere. I quickly finished the meal and left, still trying to forget what I had experienced but I couldn't. From the menu I suspect the Smrat's Chung King original might be a good place to try, but certainly not at this branch in Hung Hom. I ate to forget.",

But when the same visitors complain to her about the food or service she will walk away or hang up the phone. The whole problem at this restaurant is the owners and their cheap mindset. Would not be surprised if the place closes down soon.",

          "text": "Knowing that there's another Indian vegetarian restaurant in Hung Hom other than Sharmaji, I was very interested to give it a try. Instead, it was nightmare.\n\nThis Smrat is the Hung Hom branch of Smrat Restaurant in Chung King Mansion, Tsim Sha Tsui. Maybe due to the location they sold set lunches well into the afternoon tea period, and that's where my nightmare began. Initially I wanted to order a set meal of Baingan Bhartha (mashed eggplants) with plain rice, but at the insistance of the lady owner who insisted that Baingan Bhartha went well with naan bread and not rice or else she won't serve it (that's the impression I got from her), I reluctantly changed my choice to Veg Vindaloo (how often do you hear that, but I gave it a try anyway), with plain boiled basmati rice and a cup of Masala Tea. Honestly, the so-called Veg. Vindaloo is nothing more than a spicier-than-usual vegetable curry which tasted average at best. The boiled rice is piping hot and the Masala Tea is fairly spicy and hot. All or this could not offset the very poor customer service in a hostile dining atmosphere. I quickly finished the meal and left, still trying to forget what I had experienced but I couldn't. From the menu I suspect the Smrat's Chung King original might be a good place to try, but certainly not at this branch in Hung Hom. I ate to forget.",
