          "text": "Walked pass Wing It! a few times when I visited Haven Street for food, and was caught by their witty posters inside the restaurant.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough question. For a wing lover with a considerable amount of self-love, I really don\u2019t know how to answer that!\n\nI had a nice afternoon tea with a piece of roll cake and tea before this, therefore I only opted for 4 wings combo as a light dinner before gym.\n\nI chose Wing It Buffalo with Blue Cheese dip. It was nice that I could choose mixed for the wings, two deep fried, two pan fried. I also got two Mozzarella cheese sticks to go with the wings.\n\nI digged in for the cheese sticks first. It was amazing!!! I love the fresh, hot deep fried sticky mozzarella cheese! And the wings were wonderful too! I had a bite to try the original flavour, and then quickly asked for shop assistant\u2019s suggestion about which hot sauce to try.\n\nOh my god, there are so many different types of hot sauce! It\u2019s a shame not to try at least some of them. The shop assistant (probably the owner) definitely knows his chili well. He was telling me about spiciness levels with figures of the Scoville Heat Scale! Such a pro! So I was recommended to try two relatively mild ones.\n\nI could eat quite hot, and these two did give me hot lips! But they were amazing in a flaming hot way! I only dipped the wings to get a bit of the sauce, and much more blue cheese :P It was a great combination though. If you ever visit Wing It!, which you should, you might want to ask for hot sauce recommendation :) I am sure the friendly staff would love to offer their recommendations. No worries, they have you back by selling milk if you\u2019ve gone a bit wild for the chili sauce. How considerate is that!",

For a wing lover with a considerable amount of self-love, I really don\u2019t know how to answer that!\n\nI had a nice afternoon tea with a piece of roll cake and tea before this, therefore I only opted for 4 wings combo as a light dinner before gym.\n\nI chose Wing It Buffalo with Blue Cheese dip. It was nice that I could choose mixed for the wings, two deep fried, two pan fried. I also got two Mozzarella cheese sticks to go with the wings.\n\nI digged in for the cheese sticks first. It was amazing!!! I love the fresh, hot deep fried sticky mozzarella cheese! And the wings were wonderful too! I had a bite to try the original flavour, and then quickly asked for shop assistant\u2019s suggestion about which hot sauce to try.\n\nOh my god, there are so many different types of hot sauce! It\u2019s a shame not to try at least some of them. The shop assistant (probably the owner) definitely knows his chili well. He was telling me about spiciness levels with figures of the Scoville Heat Scale! Such a pro! So I was recommended to try two relatively mild ones.\n\nI could eat quite hot, and these two did give me hot lips! But they were amazing in a flaming hot way! I only dipped the wings to get a bit of the sauce, and much more blue cheese :P It was a great combination though. If you ever visit Wing It!, which you should, you might want to ask for hot sauce recommendation :) I am sure the friendly staff would love to offer their recommendations. No worries, they have you back by selling milk if you\u2019ve gone a bit wild for the chili sauce. How considerate is that!",
