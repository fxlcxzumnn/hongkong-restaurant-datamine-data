Has ok gym with a few weight machines and a few dumbells (heaviest was only 25kg which is light imo) , monkey bars, couple of treadmills and bikes, it is free to use and  open 10 am to 9.45. I like the pullup station in particular because it has a rock climb grip which is rare. The Annoying to use compulsory wrist band. Free childcare. All other facilities such as indoor basketball court, swimming pools, table tennis and 2 lane bowling alley etc are pay by hour.  Security guard everywhere makes you feel like prisoner but everyone who lives there is semi-rich by hk standards. The men's change room is 5 star. I have never seen such a luxurious change room. It has plenty of lockers, showers. The place is wheelchair friendly. Annoying birds chirping 4am onwards making it hard to sleep. \n\nThere is also a beautiful fountain near the centre of Mayfair. \n\nIf you want to get some quiet time away from home, there are some nice areas in the middle complex. \n\nOn water side behind complex is a nice long walk where people like to jump in the sea and swim to nearby island. \n\nOn the front side low-rise units where the buses and minibus stops are, they are terrible and no privacy, especially when there is a bicycle lane directly in front of them and they are building a lot of units across the road. \n\nPublic transport is annoying as you need to yell at minibus driver in Cantonese to stop and the shuttle bus driver (which we need to pay for and not all of us drive) is terrible. On Sunday, the last mayfair shuttle from tai po market around 8.15 is full of maids so if you cannot get on and  driver will tell you to take mtr and minibus wasting over an hour of your time. Management should tell him to do another run. \n\nNote the Sha Tin minibus from Mayfair stops at one of the earlier train stations than Shatin, if you are in a hurry to get somewhere by train and can yell out the name in time. Note also, the green minibus has a speed limit and beeps every time driver exceeds the limit. I found that quite a few drivers exceeded the limit and minibus was constantly beeping which was annoying but at least it means that I arrived faster to destination. \n\nFor those driving electric cars such as Tesla, there is a charging station down the road.",

Has ok gym with a few weight machines and a few dumbells (heaviest was only 25kg which is light imo) , monkey bars, couple of treadmills and bikes, it is free to use and  open 10 am to 9.45. I like the pullup station in particular because it has a rock climb grip which is rare. The Annoying to use compulsory wrist band. Free childcare. All other facilities such as indoor basketball court, swimming pools, table tennis and 2 lane bowling alley etc are pay by hour.  Security guard everywhere makes you feel like prisoner but everyone who lives there is semi-rich by hk standards. The men's change room is 5 star. I have never seen such a luxurious change room. It has plenty of lockers, showers. The place is wheelchair friendly. Annoying birds chirping 4am onwards making it hard to sleep. \n\nThere is also a beautiful fountain near the centre of Mayfair. \n\nIf you want to get some quiet time away from home, there are some nice areas in the middle complex. \n\nOn water side behind complex is a nice long walk where people like to jump in the sea and swim to nearby island. \n\nOn the front side low-rise units where the buses and minibus stops are, they are terrible and no privacy, especially when there is a bicycle lane directly in front of them and they are building a lot of units across the road. \n\nPublic transport is annoying as you need to yell at minibus driver in Cantonese to stop and the shuttle bus driver (which we need to pay for and not all of us drive) is terrible. On Sunday, the last mayfair shuttle from tai po market around 8.15 is full of maids so if you cannot get on and  driver will tell you to take mtr and minibus wasting over an hour of your time. Management should tell him to do another run. \n\nNote the Sha Tin minibus from Mayfair stops at one of the earlier train stations than Shatin, if you are in a hurry to get somewhere by train and can yell out the name in time. Note also, the green minibus has a speed limit and beeps every time driver exceeds the limit. I found that quite a few drivers exceeded the limit and minibus was constantly beeping which was annoying but at least it means that I arrived faster to destination. \n\nFor those driving electric cars such as Tesla, there is a charging station down the road.",
