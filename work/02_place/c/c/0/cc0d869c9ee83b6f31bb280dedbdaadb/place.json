When we arrived at the Curry Lounge, the manager was very nice and careful not to rush us, but told us the kitchen was about to close for an hour to prep for dinner service but if we would like to order they would accommodate us.  Again, he was very polite, but I could tell he was also concerned about aggravating his kitchen staff.  I was a little worried what kind of quality food we would get under the circumstances, but I needn't have been.  Both of our meals were served hot and delicious! The barman and the manager/host/waiter were both perfectly attentive, friendly and courteous.",

The staffs are very nice and helpful that they\u2019d love to chat with you and refill your water. \n\nWe waited around 30 minutes for our food but here was so many people at the restaurant. It may not be a good idea for super hungry people, but I have to say their food is amazing. \n\nTheir shrimp is perfectly grilled, and marinated perfectly. My favourite dish is their tandoori chicken, it\u2019s so tender and full of flavour.",

When we arrived at the Curry Lounge, the manager was very nice and careful not to rush us, but told us the kitchen was about to close for an hour to prep for dinner service but if we would like to order they would accommodate us.  Again, he was very polite, but I could tell he was also concerned about aggravating his kitchen staff.  I was a little worried what kind of quality food we would get under the circumstances, but I needn't have been.  Both of our meals were served hot and delicious! The barman and the manager/host/waiter were both perfectly attentive, friendly and courteous.",

The staffs are very nice and helpful that they\u2019d love to chat with you and refill your water. \n\nWe waited around 30 minutes for our food but here was so many people at the restaurant. It may not be a good idea for super hungry people, but I have to say their food is amazing. \n\nTheir shrimp is perfectly grilled, and marinated perfectly. My favourite dish is their tandoori chicken, it\u2019s so tender and full of flavour.",
