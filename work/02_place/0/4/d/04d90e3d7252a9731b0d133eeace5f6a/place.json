          "text": "Emporio Antico has been nominated as one of the best 10 fine dining restaurants with wine pairing in Hong Kong. However, my friend and I were not a big drinking person. But we still enjoyed a delicious and healthy dinner at Emporio Antico with a relatively quiet environment. Most of the items on the menu are vegetarian friendly (except the mains) or gluten-free (for dessert). We had the whole restaurant to ourselves for most of the time. I guess it\u2019s one of the perks of having dinner early.\n\nFor starters, you can choose from Kale Caesar Salad, Fontina and Raclette Fondue, or Quinoa Salad. All of them are vegetarian friendly. I chose this cheesy starter and was so satisfied with the grilled fontina cheese and raclette cheese. They were so aromatic, yet not overly oily. They were very enjoyable with the sourdough toast. There was far more cheese than toast, so after I finished all my toast, I ate the cheese like mochi as it got quite sticky once it\u2019s cooled. This starter is very filling indeed.\n\nThere are 3 options for mains: Seared Chicken Breast, Seared Seabass, Grass Fed Sirloin. I picked the sirloin. It was served with beetroot, mushroom and pepper berry jus. As usual, I went for the sides first. The mushroom was so juicy and flavoured; the beetroot was so sweet and enjoyable. As for the berry jus, it tasted like beetroot to me even though it\u2019s yellow and in the shape of a pear.\n\nThe sirloin is very delicious. I was surprised that I wasn\u2019t asked how would I want my sirloin to be cooked. I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter when the steak is grilled right to the point so that you have a crunchy grilled surface with juicy and tender meat underneath. Yum!\n\nThe meal ended with a yummy gluten-free dessert. Either a Dark Chocolate Cake or Berry Trifle. I chose the dark chocolate cake. It has a hint of coconut oil flavour (like most of the gluten free desserts). The dense and moist texture make the cake a lit one and very enjoyable. I adore the heavy chocolate flavour as well as the chocolate nibs on the plate. It did make a perfect full stop to the meal.",

          "text": "Emporio Antico has been nominated as one of the best 10 fine dining restaurants with wine pairing in Hong Kong. However, my friend and I were not a big drinking person. But we still enjoyed a delicious and healthy dinner at Emporio Antico with a relatively quiet environment. Most of the items on the menu are vegetarian friendly (except the mains) or gluten-free (for dessert). We had the whole restaurant to ourselves for most of the time. I guess it\u2019s one of the perks of having dinner early.\n\nFor starters, you can choose from Kale Caesar Salad, Fontina and Raclette Fondue, or Quinoa Salad. All of them are vegetarian friendly. I chose this cheesy starter and was so satisfied with the grilled fontina cheese and raclette cheese. They were so aromatic, yet not overly oily. They were very enjoyable with the sourdough toast. There was far more cheese than toast, so after I finished all my toast, I ate the cheese like mochi as it got quite sticky once it\u2019s cooled. This starter is very filling indeed.\n\nThere are 3 options for mains: Seared Chicken Breast, Seared Seabass, Grass Fed Sirloin. I picked the sirloin. It was served with beetroot, mushroom and pepper berry jus. As usual, I went for the sides first. The mushroom was so juicy and flavoured; the beetroot was so sweet and enjoyable. As for the berry jus, it tasted like beetroot to me even though it\u2019s yellow and in the shape of a pear.\n\nThe sirloin is very delicious. I was surprised that I wasn\u2019t asked how would I want my sirloin to be cooked. I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter when the steak is grilled right to the point so that you have a crunchy grilled surface with juicy and tender meat underneath. Yum!\n\nThe meal ended with a yummy gluten-free dessert. Either a Dark Chocolate Cake or Berry Trifle. I chose the dark chocolate cake. It has a hint of coconut oil flavour (like most of the gluten free desserts). The dense and moist texture make the cake a lit one and very enjoyable. I adore the heavy chocolate flavour as well as the chocolate nibs on the plate. It did make a perfect full stop to the meal.",
