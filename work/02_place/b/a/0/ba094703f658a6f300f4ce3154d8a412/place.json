I arrived with a friend, we were both well dressed, no trainers as we were supposed to have drinks after in a nice cocktail bar. We arrived around 6:30 pm, the entrance hostess told me it was fully booked but she was going to call me if any booking is cancelled. It was fine for me. Barely 5 min after she called me telling me there was a table available, but it was on the terrace, and we would prefer inside. She phoned again a few minute later telling us there was a table free inside. My surprise was that even it was a Saturday evening, the entire time we stayed at the venue there was many empty tables empty. I asked the staff inside who told me they were not fully booked at all. So why treating us like this? The service was the most annoying and boring, they had to explain to us a whole non sense story about pizza. I went to Italy and ate pizza before (my previous reviews might attest to it), and pizza is pizza. I didn\u2019t find anything particular which justify such high price for some dough and ingredients. I will never go for sure.",

I arrived with a friend, we were both well dressed, no trainers as we were supposed to have drinks after in a nice cocktail bar. We arrived around 6:30 pm, the entrance hostess told me it was fully booked but she was going to call me if any booking is cancelled. It was fine for me. Barely 5 min after she called me telling me there was a table available, but it was on the terrace, and we would prefer inside. She phoned again a few minute later telling us there was a table free inside. My surprise was that even it was a Saturday evening, the entire time we stayed at the venue there was many empty tables empty. I asked the staff inside who told me they were not fully booked at all. So why treating us like this? The service was the most annoying and boring, they had to explain to us a whole non sense story about pizza. I went to Italy and ate pizza before (my previous reviews might attest to it), and pizza is pizza. I didn\u2019t find anything particular which justify such high price for some dough and ingredients. I will never go for sure.",

The high quality gourmet pizzas they propose are delicious, innovative and will surprise all your senses. The restaurant offers a modern and refined design including a beautiful terrace with view over the street. The staff is attentive, friendly and knows the products very well.
