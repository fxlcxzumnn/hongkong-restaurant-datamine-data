Service was decently good (4 stars) but food were placed on the table in a weird way.  We got a whole table to use but 2 tiny plates of appetizers were put on the side when the main dish did not come until 10 minutes later.  I had expected more for its price.  Seating was probably the weakest link.  It appeared unforgivably wrong when the operator claimed to have been in F&B industry for 13 years.  Couldn\u2019t hang a shopping bag or any bag to the chair.  No basket provided for you to place your bags.  Seriously?  For a restaurant inside a shopping mall?  They just couldn\u2019t care less or they expected people would be happy to put everything on the floor.  This is heartless and shall fairly tell how good a restaurant is.  Food isn\u2019t the only thing people rate a restaurant.  Food here is not good enough anyway.  Much room for improvement.  A disappointed dining experience.",

Service was decently good (4 stars) but food were placed on the table in a weird way.  We got a whole table to use but 2 tiny plates of appetizers were put on the side when the main dish did not come until 10 minutes later.  I had expected more for its price.  Seating was probably the weakest link.  It appeared unforgivably wrong when the operator claimed to have been in F&B industry for 13 years.  Couldn\u2019t hang a shopping bag or any bag to the chair.  No basket provided for you to place your bags.  Seriously?  For a restaurant inside a shopping mall?  They just couldn\u2019t care less or they expected people would be happy to put everything on the floor.  This is heartless and shall fairly tell how good a restaurant is.  Food isn\u2019t the only thing people rate a restaurant.  Food here is not good enough anyway.  Much room for improvement.  A disappointed dining experience.",
