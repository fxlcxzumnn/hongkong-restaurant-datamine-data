          "text": "How shocking it is to see another mediocre restaurant thriving in this area. \n\nThe service does not exist requiring me to wave down the waitress' attention, at every step. This wouldn't be an issue if you didn't charge a mandatory \"service charge\". Please reconsider putting it on the bill if your staff cannot accommodate people with a mostly empty restaurant properly, instead talking among themselves and ignoring the customers.\n\nThe food was shamefully bad at 158HKD for a Lamb Burger. The burger itself was a patty, cheese and sun dried tomatoes.The patty had lost all resemblance of how lamb should taste as it was mixed with a supremely strong Buffalo mix. Nowhere on the menu did it mention it was a mix, if you served this to me and told me it was beef, I probably wouldn't blink an eye, that's how out of reach the flavour of your meat was. \n\nIt was so greasy... Each bite I thought was juice coming out of the patty, I was sorely mistaken but rather it was dripping with oil with every bite. It overflowed the wooden cutting board and onto the counter. The bun was soaked to the very core with this oil.\n\nThe singular quarter slice of pickle served with the burger was mushy and tasted unlike any other pickles I've had. It's bad. You are the first restaurant to serve me mushy pickles and I hope to never encounter such a thing again.\n\nThe potato wedges that came with it were of decent flavour but perhaps the driest wedges I have ever eaten in my life. Each bite turned the potato into a more sand-like texture eventually becoming hard to swallow (literally).\n\nAt the end of \"service\", they were sweeping/mopping around my area while pulling opposing chairs around me away, perhaps wait until I leave before you begin cleaning the restaurant.\n\nI hope for your future you reflect what made you so popular, clearly what I had today was I hope; your rock bottom capabilities.",

          "text": "Appeal to the owner: Something needs to be rethink - he idea of Feather & Bone is a local neighborhood based butcher/supermarket for your imported high quality meat and cooking ingred. together with a new concept diner open 7am to 11pm serving great food to the local community. The premium food justify it's pricing, the comfortable seating (mixture of sofa, high chairs and round tables) are great for a weekend get together, a breakfast/brunch, or a quick one after work. Just next to the Central - Mid-levels escalator, the previous address was a Koh-Thai restaurant, attracting locals with its smell of spicy and prawn crackers. F&B has its unique offerings not seen in the area before, and still has a semi monopoly in that area, the closest good restaurant is the Italian restaurant off Robinson road. Many congratz to the newly opened shop across the road taking over from Pacific Coffee, so now your \"Coffee counter\" has no opposition in the morning rush hour in that area, the closest one is Elephant Ground at Craine road. \nI seriously suggest they up their game in that counter (to actually let people know it's open and has someone to serve you), services remains inattentive and as if they don't really care. Giving you the 'whatever' look whenever you walk in, does not feel welcoming at all. I can understand this might happens when they are peak busy at Sunday brunch, which I also experienced, however I also visited at 3pm once with me being the ONLY customer, 1 behind the counter at the grill, one in the kitchen, 2 at the shopfloor, my Steak and Egg took a reasonable 20 mins to be prepared, which was excellent, I would not mind if they asked me how I want my steak, turns out okay at medium Rare for my taste. I was half way through my steak before my FlatWhite shows up, which is what 25 mins after I ordered my food + Coffee - how does that work? The coffee counter is never 'manned', one staff wander around looking busy, while another is handling some restocking. Never anyone to greet customers walking through the door, door's open with the sign \"Closed\" facing out which is also odd. Furthermore the opening hours did not specify when does Breakfast/Lunch ends and the Dinner menu starts, with its long opening hour I would love to see some all-day offerings which will be a great hit also. \nSo to sum up, please do go for the good food if you crave for a nice steak, forget the wine/coffee and expects little services, and if you have some time to spare because service is currently still a bit slow, 6 months since I first visited.",

          "text": "How shocking it is to see another mediocre restaurant thriving in this area. \n\nThe service does not exist requiring me to wave down the waitress' attention, at every step. This wouldn't be an issue if you didn't charge a mandatory \"service charge\". Please reconsider putting it on the bill if your staff cannot accommodate people with a mostly empty restaurant properly, instead talking among themselves and ignoring the customers.\n\nThe food was shamefully bad at 158HKD for a Lamb Burger. The burger itself was a patty, cheese and sun dried tomatoes.The patty had lost all resemblance of how lamb should taste as it was mixed with a supremely strong Buffalo mix. Nowhere on the menu did it mention it was a mix, if you served this to me and told me it was beef, I probably wouldn't blink an eye, that's how out of reach the flavour of your meat was. \n\nIt was so greasy... Each bite I thought was juice coming out of the patty, I was sorely mistaken but rather it was dripping with oil with every bite. It overflowed the wooden cutting board and onto the counter. The bun was soaked to the very core with this oil.\n\nThe singular quarter slice of pickle served with the burger was mushy and tasted unlike any other pickles I've had. It's bad. You are the first restaurant to serve me mushy pickles and I hope to never encounter such a thing again.\n\nThe potato wedges that came with it were of decent flavour but perhaps the driest wedges I have ever eaten in my life. Each bite turned the potato into a more sand-like texture eventually becoming hard to swallow (literally).\n\nAt the end of \"service\", they were sweeping/mopping around my area while pulling opposing chairs around me away, perhaps wait until I leave before you begin cleaning the restaurant.\n\nI hope for your future you reflect what made you so popular, clearly what I had today was I hope; your rock bottom capabilities.",

          "text": "Appeal to the owner: Something needs to be rethink - he idea of Feather & Bone is a local neighborhood based butcher/supermarket for your imported high quality meat and cooking ingred. together with a new concept diner open 7am to 11pm serving great food to the local community. The premium food justify it's pricing, the comfortable seating (mixture of sofa, high chairs and round tables) are great for a weekend get together, a breakfast/brunch, or a quick one after work. Just next to the Central - Mid-levels escalator, the previous address was a Koh-Thai restaurant, attracting locals with its smell of spicy and prawn crackers. F&B has its unique offerings not seen in the area before, and still has a semi monopoly in that area, the closest good restaurant is the Italian restaurant off Robinson road. Many congratz to the newly opened shop across the road taking over from Pacific Coffee, so now your \"Coffee counter\" has no opposition in the morning rush hour in that area, the closest one is Elephant Ground at Craine road. \nI seriously suggest they up their game in that counter (to actually let people know it's open and has someone to serve you), services remains inattentive and as if they don't really care. Giving you the 'whatever' look whenever you walk in, does not feel welcoming at all. I can understand this might happens when they are peak busy at Sunday brunch, which I also experienced, however I also visited at 3pm once with me being the ONLY customer, 1 behind the counter at the grill, one in the kitchen, 2 at the shopfloor, my Steak and Egg took a reasonable 20 mins to be prepared, which was excellent, I would not mind if they asked me how I want my steak, turns out okay at medium Rare for my taste. I was half way through my steak before my FlatWhite shows up, which is what 25 mins after I ordered my food + Coffee - how does that work? The coffee counter is never 'manned', one staff wander around looking busy, while another is handling some restocking. Never anyone to greet customers walking through the door, door's open with the sign \"Closed\" facing out which is also odd. Furthermore the opening hours did not specify when does Breakfast/Lunch ends and the Dinner menu starts, with its long opening hour I would love to see some all-day offerings which will be a great hit also. \nSo to sum up, please do go for the good food if you crave for a nice steak, forget the wine/coffee and expects little services, and if you have some time to spare because service is currently still a bit slow, 6 months since I first visited.",
