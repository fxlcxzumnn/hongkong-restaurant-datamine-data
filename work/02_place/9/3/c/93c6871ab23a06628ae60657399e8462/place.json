So i waited in my seat. To my surprise, I was kicked out by the waiter and i was just asking 1 more minute to wait for my friend to come back, and the waitress asked me to get my friend\u2019s bag and out of the restaurant and even said how heavy my friend\u2019s bag going to be.

There is constantly a long line, and unlike other small unassuming Hong Kong restaurants in the Michelin guide, Yat Lok has jacked up the prices to ridiculous levels. Very disappointing",

The meat was really tender and very flavorful, although it can get a little salty, it's really worth the money! \n\nGenerally all the food served here were on the saltier side but it was really good.\n\nService was typical, due to the limited seating of the shop they would probably chase you out after you finish your food so don't expect to stay for long.",

So i waited in my seat. To my surprise, I was kicked out by the waiter and i was just asking 1 more minute to wait for my friend to come back, and the waitress asked me to get my friend\u2019s bag and out of the restaurant and even said how heavy my friend\u2019s bag going to be.

          "text": "This place is way overrated. The goose is not that good, oily and skin not that crispy. Roast pork was quite nice with very crunchy skin. Food itself was not too bad, but there are much better places around. The downside is that since it is affiliated with Michelin (not sure if they even have a star) and is quite famous, it is a massive tourist trap. There is constantly a long line, and unlike other small unassuming Hong Kong restaurants in the Michelin guide, Yat Lok has jacked up the prices to ridiculous levels. Very disappointing",
