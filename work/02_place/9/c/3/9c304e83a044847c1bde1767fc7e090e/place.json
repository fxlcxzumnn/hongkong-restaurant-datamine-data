The person who answered the phone answered in Chinese and I asked if she could speak English and she said \"No\" and then there was this long silence. I wasn't even sure if this was even Neway because she didn't say anything when she answered the phone. I asked if she could transfer me to someone who can speak English. I waited awhile and she came back and said \"NO!\" and \"call back later.\" I asked what time and she said \"call back later\" and I asked again \"WHAT TIME\" and then she finally said \"ONE HOUR.\"\n\nAnyways, I finally got through to someone who confirmed that we would pay $209 per person at 7pm and sing for 2 hours (what I was quoted 10 days before). I confirmed with all my friends and things were all good until I get a call in the evening from someone shouting that I need to pay $249 for no apparent reason, something about \"summer hours\" and then later something about \"somebody look at the wrong time\" (which doesn't make sense since I confirmed twice with different people).\n\n I politely told her that I was quoted a price when I booked, and even took the initiate to call and confirm that price this morning but she just kept shouting \"$249!!!\" and putting me on hold for various lengths of time only to return and keep repeating \"$249!!!!!!!!\" and started giving a number for a random hotline....??\n\nI asked to speak the manager and she said NO HE WON'T GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT PRICE and then another girl told me that he'd call me back in an hour. I waited and no call.\n\nWe later went to Mr. Red where we can sing for double the time and get unlimited drinks for only $100 more. Neway is horrible and talking to them is like talking to a brick wall as they don't listen to you and just shout over you and raise prices randomly right before you show up. \n\nThanks for ruining my birthday, Neway.",

The person who answered the phone answered in Chinese and I asked if she could speak English and she said \"No\" and then there was this long silence. I wasn't even sure if this was even Neway because she didn't say anything when she answered the phone. I asked if she could transfer me to someone who can speak English. I waited awhile and she came back and said \"NO!\" and \"call back later.\" I asked what time and she said \"call back later\" and I asked again \"WHAT TIME\" and then she finally said \"ONE HOUR.\"\n\nAnyways, I finally got through to someone who confirmed that we would pay $209 per person at 7pm and sing for 2 hours (what I was quoted 10 days before). I confirmed with all my friends and things were all good until I get a call in the evening from someone shouting that I need to pay $249 for no apparent reason, something about \"summer hours\" and then later something about \"somebody look at the wrong time\" (which doesn't make sense since I confirmed twice with different people).\n\n I politely told her that I was quoted a price when I booked, and even took the initiate to call and confirm that price this morning but she just kept shouting \"$249!!!\" and putting me on hold for various lengths of time only to return and keep repeating \"$249!!!!!!!!\" and started giving a number for a random hotline....??\n\nI asked to speak the manager and she said NO HE WON'T GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT PRICE and then another girl told me that he'd call me back in an hour. I waited and no call.\n\nWe later went to Mr. Red where we can sing for double the time and get unlimited drinks for only $100 more. Neway is horrible and talking to them is like talking to a brick wall as they don't listen to you and just shout over you and raise prices randomly right before you show up. \n\nThanks for ruining my birthday, Neway.",
