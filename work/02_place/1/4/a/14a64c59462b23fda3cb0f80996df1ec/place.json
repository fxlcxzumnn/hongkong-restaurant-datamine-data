          "text": "We went a bit further to Stanley for date night dinner on Sunday. Famous for their brilliant British food, Pickled Pelican is a British restaurant and bar located at the promenade of Stanley main street. Pickled Pelican is a two-story restaurant with outdoor seating area on the ground floor, and a pool table on the second floor. We made a reservation in advanced, and were seated on the second floor with a table by the window as we wished. Awesome! We were able to enjoy the sea view without being blown by the strong wind XD We do recommend the second floor for the time being!\n\nWe ordered a drink to start with. Red wine for my partner, and Oreo Milkshake for me. The milkshake was definitely fantastic! It\u2019s so smooth and flavoured! Yet not overly sweet nor stuffing with the cookies and cream ice cream in it. It\u2019s truly enjoyable even throughout the meal!\n\nWe came for this Cheezy Lava burger, which was a gourmet beef burger with melted cheese sauce and bacon! It\u2019s absolutely delightful and wowing! The melted cheese sauce was so yummy! It didn\u2019t solidify very quickly, so that you could still enjoy this melted cheese with the beef burger. We opted for medium for the beef, and the meaty beef was thicker than the burger itself! The thin crispy bacon on top was great too! We simply loved everything about this burger!\n\nWe upgraded our fries to Cheesy Guacamole Fries. You would never know guacamole could go so well with cheese to give you a foodgasm with ordinary fries until you try it!\n\nAnother dish we ordered was this Weekend special Lobster Pie. It was funny how the lobster shell was positioned to look at you when served. It was an empty shell though, but all the meat was in the pie, as well as the crawls on top. We liked this potato mash seafood pie a lot. Some of the lobster meat tasted a bit too fishy to me though.\n\nOn the whole, we were very satisfied with the dining environment and food at Pickled Pelican, it\u2019s a great place for a chillaxing date night dinner.",

          "text": "We went a bit further to Stanley for date night dinner on Sunday. Famous for their brilliant British food, Pickled Pelican is a British restaurant and bar located at the promenade of Stanley main street. Pickled Pelican is a two-story restaurant with outdoor seating area on the ground floor, and a pool table on the second floor. We made a reservation in advanced, and were seated on the second floor with a table by the window as we wished. Awesome! We were able to enjoy the sea view without being blown by the strong wind XD We do recommend the second floor for the time being!\n\nWe ordered a drink to start with. Red wine for my partner, and Oreo Milkshake for me. The milkshake was definitely fantastic! It\u2019s so smooth and flavoured! Yet not overly sweet nor stuffing with the cookies and cream ice cream in it. It\u2019s truly enjoyable even throughout the meal!\n\nWe came for this Cheezy Lava burger, which was a gourmet beef burger with melted cheese sauce and bacon! It\u2019s absolutely delightful and wowing! The melted cheese sauce was so yummy! It didn\u2019t solidify very quickly, so that you could still enjoy this melted cheese with the beef burger. We opted for medium for the beef, and the meaty beef was thicker than the burger itself! The thin crispy bacon on top was great too! We simply loved everything about this burger!\n\nWe upgraded our fries to Cheesy Guacamole Fries. You would never know guacamole could go so well with cheese to give you a foodgasm with ordinary fries until you try it!\n\nAnother dish we ordered was this Weekend special Lobster Pie. It was funny how the lobster shell was positioned to look at you when served. It was an empty shell though, but all the meat was in the pie, as well as the crawls on top. We liked this potato mash seafood pie a lot. Some of the lobster meat tasted a bit too fishy to me though.\n\nOn the whole, we were very satisfied with the dining environment and food at Pickled Pelican, it\u2019s a great place for a chillaxing date night dinner.",
