The buffalo wings was done too well and it was like dry fibre. The batter on the fish was fried too deeply that it almost carried a burnt taste, and the fish was, as expected, frozen food with no taste of fish in it. Oh !!

          "text": "Dan Ryan's used to be one of the staple of American style BBQ and steak house, but over the years their quality have deteriorated a lot and has just turned into a generic Hong Kong style \"western\" restaurant.\n\nService at this particular restaurant was pretty bad. You see waiters running back and forth as if they are busy, but they just look like a bunch of chickens with their heads chopped off. I ordered their blond ale, the easiest drink to serve, to try as we ordered our food and they somehow completely ignored my order. I had to chase it twice before it was served to me.\n\nThey have no clue the particular order food is supposed to be served, usually its salads and appetizers first then the mains, but they managed to mess that up. They basically served which ever food they made first.\n\nGetting the check was another ordeal. The place wasnt overly packed when we asked for our check, but we had to ask 3 different people at 3 different times before our check was given to us. The waiter just flopped down the check and rushed off to do some other stuff and we had to wave our hands around to flag down another waiter to collect our credit card.\n\nOverall it was a pretty poor experience.",
