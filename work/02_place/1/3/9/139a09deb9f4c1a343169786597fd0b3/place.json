But Brad did such a wonderful job, it's exactly what I wanted! I've never loved a haircut that much, I feel like a new person!\n\nEverything was great from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. I never felt rushed out of the salon like it sometimes happens in some places and Brad is very nice to chat with.\nHe helped me want to take care of my hair more and visit the salon more in the future, which is saying something coming from me!\nThank you for the great experience and haircut!",

Adam came to the rescue and I could instantly tell that he really knew his stuff and that I was in good hands! He did an incredible job repairing the damage and I couldn\u2019t recommend him highly enough. \n\nThe staff are very friendly and attentive.

Rude and unprofessional.  \n\n1) After a brief 2 minute discussion on highlights vs touch-up of roots, he said \"If it's too confusing for you, you better just stick with single color touch-ups\". Basically too lazy to explain further and said condescendingly. \n\n2) After a further brief discussion about what hair color and agreeing to go dark brown (he didn't ask me which brand I wanted) - he disappears and returns with the paste already mixed. In other hair salons, I always get shown the color charts to confirm the brand and color code (unless I am a regular which clearly I am not here).  I ask: Is this Wella or Organix and can you confirm it's ammonia-free?  He goes err, no this is wella and no, it's not ammonia-free - you should have asked during the \"consultation\". Rude way to talk to a customer. \n\nI told him I had assumed all their dyes are ammonia free because I had asked the lady over the phone booking my appointment whether they have ammonia free dyes and she had said both their Wella and Organix are ammonia-free. He goes \"well she's the receptionist, you need to ask me. Now let's just repeat the consultation.\" - patronising.  \n\nWell firstly, I didn't ask you because you just disappeared and I \nthought you were coming back with the charts of both Wella and Organics and that we were going to have a further conversation.  Secondly, you're the stylist, you should ask me whether I want ammonia-free, not the other way around.\n\nJust plain rude attitude with not a single contrite tone; not suitable for the hospitality industry.  If the management is going to write back with a rude defensive remark, just save your words.",

But Brad did such a wonderful job, it's exactly what I wanted! I've never loved a haircut that much, I feel like a new person!\n\nEverything was great from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. I never felt rushed out of the salon like it sometimes happens in some places and Brad is very nice to chat with.\nHe helped me want to take care of my hair more and visit the salon more in the future, which is saying something coming from me!\nThank you for the great experience and haircut!",

Adam came to the rescue and I could instantly tell that he really knew his stuff and that I was in good hands! He did an incredible job repairing the damage and I couldn\u2019t recommend him highly enough. \n\nThe staff are very friendly and attentive.

Rude and unprofessional.  \n\n1) After a brief 2 minute discussion on highlights vs touch-up of roots, he said \"If it's too confusing for you, you better just stick with single color touch-ups\". Basically too lazy to explain further and said condescendingly. \n\n2) After a further brief discussion about what hair color and agreeing to go dark brown (he didn't ask me which brand I wanted) - he disappears and returns with the paste already mixed. In other hair salons, I always get shown the color charts to confirm the brand and color code (unless I am a regular which clearly I am not here).  I ask: Is this Wella or Organix and can you confirm it's ammonia-free?  He goes err, no this is wella and no, it's not ammonia-free - you should have asked during the \"consultation\". Rude way to talk to a customer. \n\nI told him I had assumed all their dyes are ammonia free because I had asked the lady over the phone booking my appointment whether they have ammonia free dyes and she had said both their Wella and Organix are ammonia-free. He goes \"well she's the receptionist, you need to ask me. Now let's just repeat the consultation.\" - patronising.  \n\nWell firstly, I didn't ask you because you just disappeared and I \nthought you were coming back with the charts of both Wella and Organics and that we were going to have a further conversation.  Secondly, you're the stylist, you should ask me whether I want ammonia-free, not the other way around.\n\nJust plain rude attitude with not a single contrite tone; not suitable for the hospitality industry.  If the management is going to write back with a rude defensive remark, just save your words.",
