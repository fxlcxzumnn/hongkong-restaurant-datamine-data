Pappardelle with ragu is my favorite for its creamy, sweet tomato sauce. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend zucchini noodle because of its excessive black garlic that I doubt matches with the taste of ricotta. \n\nMain dish was made horrible by the fridge-tasting ingredients like steak and salmon.\n\nIf you were bold enough, you could pick some of their drinks and see how they go. I tried a few, and I found Matcha Soy Latte and juice blends are among what I view as good combination. I never thought of replacing milk with soy in latte, but it came out to be an ideal alternative. I like how the soy tuned down the overall taste, and it went well with the bitterness of matcha too.",

Chased up twice, then brought over red, waited 5 more minutes to rectify such a stupid mistake and finally got my order.\n\nSeriously, not rocket science! The quality of the service is directly correlated with the quality of the manager. So when I say incompetent staff, I really mean the manager primarily and he has to take most of the responsibility.\n\nServers these days leave half a brain at home and only use half of whatever remaining to do their job. Too many distractions (their phones, for one thing) and lose focus on what they are doing.  Smartphone should be banned when the staff is on the clock. \n\nThe food is ok, though rather pricey.",

          "text": "We visited Habitu Table in the basement of Mira Mall for a late breakfast whilst staying at The Mira hotel opposite. The food was ok, but the service was terrible. I\u2019ve never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant in Hong Kong - the woman who served us was quite obviously put out by the fact that we could not speak fluent Cantonese. I\u2019m guessing this is because my fianc\u00e9e is from HK and therefore many people assume that she is fluent at first, but whereas this is normally handled kindly when it becomes clear she isn\u2019t, the attitude of the waitress at Habitu quickly changed.\n\nWe ordered two breakfasts, one of which arrived at least ten minutes before the other. I asked twice for no mushrooms as I simply can\u2019t stand them, but the meal arrived with them regardless. I didn\u2019t complain and just ate around them as by that point we both just wanted to leave as quickly as possible. We struggled to get her attention but at the same time noted that the tables around us were given much more attentive service. There was a second member of staff who delivered some items to the table who was much more pleasant, so this really did seem to be an issue with this one individual.\n\nWe\u2019ve both worked in similar customer facing roles before so are far from difficult or unpleasant customers. We are always kind and appreciative of servers as we know how hard this type of role can be, and we actually generally benefit in return from pleasant service. I only say this as I often assume that people who receive poor or indifferent service are demanding or difficult customers, but this could not be further from the case in this instance.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that we had such a poor experience as would have likely returned at least once or twice over the course of our eleven nights at The Mira for breakfast. Easily the worst dining experience we\u2019ve ever had in Hong Kong.",

Pappardelle with ragu is my favorite for its creamy, sweet tomato sauce. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend zucchini noodle because of its excessive black garlic that I doubt matches with the taste of ricotta. \n\nMain dish was made horrible by the fridge-tasting ingredients like steak and salmon.\n\nIf you were bold enough, you could pick some of their drinks and see how they go. I tried a few, and I found Matcha Soy Latte and juice blends are among what I view as good combination. I never thought of replacing milk with soy in latte, but it came out to be an ideal alternative. I like how the soy tuned down the overall taste, and it went well with the bitterness of matcha too.",

Chased up twice, then brought over red, waited 5 more minutes to rectify such a stupid mistake and finally got my order.\n\nSeriously, not rocket science! The quality of the service is directly correlated with the quality of the manager. So when I say incompetent staff, I really mean the manager primarily and he has to take most of the responsibility.\n\nServers these days leave half a brain at home and only use half of whatever remaining to do their job. Too many distractions (their phones, for one thing) and lose focus on what they are doing.  Smartphone should be banned when the staff is on the clock. \n\nThe food is ok, though rather pricey.",
