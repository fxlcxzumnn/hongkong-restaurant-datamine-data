          "text": "The Food Factory claims to serve really high quality food at a very affordable price, but of course it\u2019s not. You don\u2019t have high expectation when you dine in Mong Kok, but it was a rather disappointing dining experience at the Food Factory.\n\nVisiting on an early Monday evening at 6pm, the Food Factory was quite empty even though it\u2019s a public holiday. There was only one waiter working at the moment, which was fine. But this waiter wasn\u2019t really friendly. He told me to wait a bit at the entrance very bluntly. I thought, okay, maybe there were staff resting inside, or the restaurant wasn\u2019t ready yet. So I waited. But it turned out that the waiter wanted to clear some dishes on a table which no one was waiting for instead of leading me inside to where my friend was seated.\n\nAnd the table we got was horrible. It was blown by strong air con. We were too kind to tolerate the freezing air for half of the meal. But we couldn\u2019t stand it anymore when the second main was served, so we asked the waiter if he could adjust the air con. In reply, he helped us to move to another table, which was fine. Three parties entered after that, and none of them could take that table. Why couldn\u2019t the Food Factory do something about it if it\u2019s intolerable by your customers?\n\nBack to food, we ordered set A, thinking that it appeared to be a good deal\u2026\n\nWhen we picked up the eating utensils, we were a bit surprised by how dirty they were\u2026They were a bit greasy with water stains\u2026Gosh\u2026We really didn\u2019t want to use them\u2026\n\nAppetizer was the best dish in this meal. Yet, it\u2019s still far from satisfactory. White bread stripes were toasted to become \u201cToasts\u201d, which were actually toasties\u2026For each toasty, there was a lump of apple sauce on top of a piece of scallop. The scallop was quite nice, meaty and juicy. Toasty and apple sauce were ordinary.\n\nThe lobster soup was okay as there were pieces of lobster meat inside. But the soup itself was a bit powdery. You can decide yourself whether it\u2019s worth HKD$12 to top up for this.\n\nThis Paella Rice was more like risotto. The sauce made the rice really wet and stuffing. The seafood on top was really fishy\u2026even for me who could eat really fishy stuff\u2026We struggled to finished the seafood and most of the rice so as to not waste food\u2026\n\nAnd here comes the most disappointing dish of all - Slow Cook Whole Beef Rib. I had never had any rib that is this fat\u2026As you can see from the picture, there was a whole piece of fat on the left at the bottom, and the top stack of beef was all wrapped with a thick layer of fat\u2026And the meat tasted funny too, as in being prepared with lots of soda powder to make it tender\u2026Also, we were not asked how we want the rib to be done\u2026The asparagus and purple sweet potato on the side were good though.\n\nDessert was Creme Brulee. We already lost all expectation at this point and just wanted to finish it and leave.\n\nWe regretted trusting Facebook post/IG story and picked The Food Factory. For this price, we could have much better service and quality food on the island side. :(",

          "text": "The Food Factory claims to serve really high quality food at a very affordable price, but of course it\u2019s not. You don\u2019t have high expectation when you dine in Mong Kok, but it was a rather disappointing dining experience at the Food Factory.\n\nVisiting on an early Monday evening at 6pm, the Food Factory was quite empty even though it\u2019s a public holiday. There was only one waiter working at the moment, which was fine. But this waiter wasn\u2019t really friendly. He told me to wait a bit at the entrance very bluntly. I thought, okay, maybe there were staff resting inside, or the restaurant wasn\u2019t ready yet. So I waited. But it turned out that the waiter wanted to clear some dishes on a table which no one was waiting for instead of leading me inside to where my friend was seated.\n\nAnd the table we got was horrible. It was blown by strong air con. We were too kind to tolerate the freezing air for half of the meal. But we couldn\u2019t stand it anymore when the second main was served, so we asked the waiter if he could adjust the air con. In reply, he helped us to move to another table, which was fine. Three parties entered after that, and none of them could take that table. Why couldn\u2019t the Food Factory do something about it if it\u2019s intolerable by your customers?\n\nBack to food, we ordered set A, thinking that it appeared to be a good deal\u2026\n\nWhen we picked up the eating utensils, we were a bit surprised by how dirty they were\u2026They were a bit greasy with water stains\u2026Gosh\u2026We really didn\u2019t want to use them\u2026\n\nAppetizer was the best dish in this meal. Yet, it\u2019s still far from satisfactory. White bread stripes were toasted to become \u201cToasts\u201d, which were actually toasties\u2026For each toasty, there was a lump of apple sauce on top of a piece of scallop. The scallop was quite nice, meaty and juicy. Toasty and apple sauce were ordinary.\n\nThe lobster soup was okay as there were pieces of lobster meat inside. But the soup itself was a bit powdery. You can decide yourself whether it\u2019s worth HKD$12 to top up for this.\n\nThis Paella Rice was more like risotto. The sauce made the rice really wet and stuffing. The seafood on top was really fishy\u2026even for me who could eat really fishy stuff\u2026We struggled to finished the seafood and most of the rice so as to not waste food\u2026\n\nAnd here comes the most disappointing dish of all - Slow Cook Whole Beef Rib. I had never had any rib that is this fat\u2026As you can see from the picture, there was a whole piece of fat on the left at the bottom, and the top stack of beef was all wrapped with a thick layer of fat\u2026And the meat tasted funny too, as in being prepared with lots of soda powder to make it tender\u2026Also, we were not asked how we want the rib to be done\u2026The asparagus and purple sweet potato on the side were good though.\n\nDessert was Creme Brulee. We already lost all expectation at this point and just wanted to finish it and leave.\n\nWe regretted trusting Facebook post/IG story and picked The Food Factory. For this price, we could have much better service and quality food on the island side. :(",
