Can take up to 20 min to order or get the bill even when the place is half empty (pretty sure it is not understaffed as you can see 4-5 of them there for a small restaurant but 2-3 of them would be talking in the corner somewhere and ignoring the customers).  When you need some service, it is not uncommon to have some hard-faced staff coming to your table with the \"look\" telling you that you are disturbing them walking from A to B.  Only about 10% of the time some of the staff would show some manners. \n\nFood quality - Food quality deteriorated significantly.  Their salad seem to have more cheap and rotten lettuce compared to the spinach and kale they used to serve.\n\nGo there only if you work nearby and have no choice when all other places are full.",

          "text": "My mum and I went here looking for somewhere to have a quick & healthy (diet) dinner, as we only had 40 minutes before we were booked to see a film in the cinema upstairs. We selected this place due to the fact that I spotted a few empty seats out-front, so assumed service would be fast and the food on offer looked healthy.\nWe weren't immediately approached to be seated, which isn't a big deal, but since we were in a rush we asked if we could have a table for 2, to which we were told to take our pick. \nWe were immediately given menus, and ordered our food and drinks. The food didn't take long to arrive, and I was pleasantly surprised by the large portion size, seeing as how I am on a diet! \nI had a Chicken Cobb salad, which was nice. I really liked the blue cheese it came with, otherwise it was a satisfyingly filling & healthy meal before the film, and left me full for the remainder of the evening. The salad was satisfyingly portioned with chicken, bacon and everything else. The bread was a little tough, but was a small enough piece not to matter, and worked well for me as a sort of bruschetta bread-base, on which I spread some cheese and piled some salad on top. \nBefore we finished our meal we promptly requested our bill, and explained we had a movie to catch, then the bill came and was settled. \nI must say that after seeing a couple of recent reviews from a few months ago, that we had no problems at all with the service, and the service from both our servers was very attentive and accommodating to our rushed needs.\nMy attached picture might not be the prettiest as I snapped it quickly before digging in.\nApologies for the long review, but I feel the past service comments may have been taken into account, and are not reflective of my personal experience, so felt like I should give a full review of my brief experience. - Working in the F&B business for a time myself, I can appreciate how negative experiences are more often voiced online, and this place was given an average of 3.3, and to me, it should at LEAST be a 3.5. So I felt the need to give a well-deserved, from my experience, good review.",

          "text": "Terrible and rude staff - Don't know how this place is managed but some staff have an attitude problem.  Can take up to 20 min to order or get the bill even when the place is half empty (pretty sure it is not understaffed as you can see 4-5 of them there for a small restaurant but 2-3 of them would be talking in the corner somewhere and ignoring the customers).  When you need some service, it is not uncommon to have some hard-faced staff coming to your table with the \"look\" telling you that you are disturbing them walking from A to B.  Only about 10% of the time some of the staff would show some manners. \n\nFood quality - Food quality deteriorated significantly.  Their salad seem to have more cheap and rotten lettuce compared to the spinach and kale they used to serve.\n\nGo there only if you work nearby and have no choice when all other places are full.",

          "text": "My mum and I went here looking for somewhere to have a quick & healthy (diet) dinner, as we only had 40 minutes before we were booked to see a film in the cinema upstairs. We selected this place due to the fact that I spotted a few empty seats out-front, so assumed service would be fast and the food on offer looked healthy.\nWe weren't immediately approached to be seated, which isn't a big deal, but since we were in a rush we asked if we could have a table for 2, to which we were told to take our pick. \nWe were immediately given menus, and ordered our food and drinks. The food didn't take long to arrive, and I was pleasantly surprised by the large portion size, seeing as how I am on a diet! \nI had a Chicken Cobb salad, which was nice. I really liked the blue cheese it came with, otherwise it was a satisfyingly filling & healthy meal before the film, and left me full for the remainder of the evening. The salad was satisfyingly portioned with chicken, bacon and everything else. The bread was a little tough, but was a small enough piece not to matter, and worked well for me as a sort of bruschetta bread-base, on which I spread some cheese and piled some salad on top. \nBefore we finished our meal we promptly requested our bill, and explained we had a movie to catch, then the bill came and was settled. \nI must say that after seeing a couple of recent reviews from a few months ago, that we had no problems at all with the service, and the service from both our servers was very attentive and accommodating to our rushed needs.\nMy attached picture might not be the prettiest as I snapped it quickly before digging in.\nApologies for the long review, but I feel the past service comments may have been taken into account, and are not reflective of my personal experience, so felt like I should give a full review of my brief experience. - Working in the F&B business for a time myself, I can appreciate how negative experiences are more often voiced online, and this place was given an average of 3.3, and to me, it should at LEAST be a 3.5. So I felt the need to give a well-deserved, from my experience, good review.",
