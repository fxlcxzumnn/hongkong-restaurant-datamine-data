          "text": "Very horrible service from an older lady and food is not only overpriced but also not tasty. I was confused why it's so famous because it's one of the worst Korean foods I've had in a long time. Maybe HK-ers have different tastes but it's far from what you'd get in Korea. We decided to order barbequed pork, two soups, a pancake, fried chicken and some rice balls between the 6 of us and if it wasnt enough we would order more. The lady (who I assume is the owner) was annoyed with us and told us that it wouldn't be enough for us. She was visibly annoyed as if she thought we were too cheap to order a good amount and gave us attitude for the rest of the night. From the beginning, she gave us only one set of side dishes for 6 people, and there wasnt even enough for us to have 1 piece each (for example, there were 3 cubes of potatoes for one of the dishes). In an authentic Korean place, they'd always give you at least 2 sets if there are 6 people. Why would you give the same amount to 2 people as you would to 6...When asked, she said they dont do refills for the side dishes and could only refill them for us once, so we requested for them to be refilled for that one time. She told us to wait and never refilled them. When the dishes came, the portions were so small for the price so we understood why she told us it was too little food. Obviously we didnt end up ordering more as we didnt enjoy the food. The fried chicken was very underwhelming and the dwenjangjigae didnt taste like any I've ever had before (it was a mixture of dwenjang and red oil...). The only thing that met expectations was the ox bone soup, which tasted as it usually does in Korean cuisine. We left quickly and went for dessert to fill up our stomachs instead.",

              "text": "Very horrible service from an older lady and food is not only overpriced but also not tasty. I was confused why it's so famous because it's one of the worst Korean foods I've had in a long time. Maybe HK-ers have different tastes but it's far from what you'd get in Korea. We decided to order barbequed pork, two soups, a pancake, fried chicken and some rice balls between the 6 of us and if it wasnt enough we would order more. The lady (who I assume is the owner) was annoyed with us and told us that it wouldn't be enough for us. She was visibly annoyed as if she thought we were too cheap to order a good amount and gave us attitude for the rest of the night. From the beginning, she gave us only one set of side dishes for 6 people, and there wasnt even enough for us to have 1 piece each (for example, there were 3 cubes of potatoes for one of the dishes). In an authentic Korean place, they'd always give you at least 2 sets if there are 6 people. Why would you give the same amount to 2 people as you would to 6...When asked, she said they dont do refills for the side dishes and could only refill them for us once, so we requested for them to be refilled for that one time. She told us to wait and never refilled them. When the dishes came, the portions were so small for the price so we understood why she told us it was too little food. Obviously we didnt end up ordering more as we didnt enjoy the food. The fried chicken was very underwhelming and the dwenjangjigae didnt taste like any I've ever had before (it was a mixture of dwenjang and red oil...). The only thing that met expectations was the ox bone soup, which tasted as it usually does in Korean cuisine. We left quickly and went for dessert to fill up our stomachs instead.",

              "text": "Very horrible service from an older lady and food is not only overpriced but also not tasty. I was confused why it's so famous because it's one of the worst Korean foods I've had in a long time. Maybe HK-ers have different tastes but it's far from what you'd get in Korea. We decided to order barbequed pork, two soups, a pancake, fried chicken and some rice balls between the 6 of us and if it wasnt enough we would order more. The lady (who I assume is the owner) was annoyed with us and told us that it wouldn't be enough for us. She was visibly annoyed as if she thought we were too cheap to order a good amount and gave us attitude for the rest of the night. From the beginning, she gave us only one set of side dishes for 6 people, and there wasnt even enough for us to have 1 piece each (for example, there were 3 cubes of potatoes for one of the dishes). In an authentic Korean place, they'd always give you at least 2 sets if there are 6 people. Why would you give the same amount to 2 people as you would to 6...When asked, she said they dont do refills for the side dishes and could only refill them for us once, so we requested for them to be refilled for that one time. She told us to wait and never refilled them. When the dishes came, the portions were so small for the price so we understood why she told us it was too little food. Obviously we didnt end up ordering more as we didnt enjoy the food. The fried chicken was very underwhelming and the dwenjangjigae didnt taste like any I've ever had before (it was a mixture of dwenjang and red oil...). The only thing that met expectations was the ox bone soup, which tasted as it usually does in Korean cuisine. We left quickly and went for dessert to fill up our stomachs instead.",

          "text": "Very horrible service from an older lady and food is not only overpriced but also not tasty. I was confused why it's so famous because it's one of the worst Korean foods I've had in a long time. Maybe HK-ers have different tastes but it's far from what you'd get in Korea. We decided to order barbequed pork, two soups, a pancake, fried chicken and some rice balls between the 6 of us and if it wasnt enough we would order more. The lady (who I assume is the owner) was annoyed with us and told us that it wouldn't be enough for us. She was visibly annoyed as if she thought we were too cheap to order a good amount and gave us attitude for the rest of the night. From the beginning, she gave us only one set of side dishes for 6 people, and there wasnt even enough for us to have 1 piece each (for example, there were 3 cubes of potatoes for one of the dishes). In an authentic Korean place, they'd always give you at least 2 sets if there are 6 people. Why would you give the same amount to 2 people as you would to 6...When asked, she said they dont do refills for the side dishes and could only refill them for us once, so we requested for them to be refilled for that one time. She told us to wait and never refilled them. When the dishes came, the portions were so small for the price so we understood why she told us it was too little food. Obviously we didnt end up ordering more as we didnt enjoy the food. The fried chicken was very underwhelming and the dwenjangjigae didnt taste like any I've ever had before (it was a mixture of dwenjang and red oil...). The only thing that met expectations was the ox bone soup, which tasted as it usually does in Korean cuisine. We left quickly and went for dessert to fill up our stomachs instead.",
