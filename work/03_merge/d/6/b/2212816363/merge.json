          "text": "Very delicious and friendly western cuisine. It's mainly served steak. The environment was excellent an comfortable. All staffs were nice and helpful, they will politely asked customers' needs and refilled fries to us. They also described the steak in detail. We have tried the homemade soup, salad, herbal steak and dessert! The tomato herbal soup was great and healthy; the salad had fresh veggies and yellowish tomatoes with sesame sauce. The medium rare herbal steak was fantastic with soft texture and full of beef taste! Love its simple sauce and sea salt, besides, the whole grilled garlic was soft and lovely taste!\nFries was so crispy and hot with truffle taste. The tomato sauce was added for increasing taste!",

I would recommend the plain flat iron. It is served with unlimited fries by default. If you want some greens, you can add just small amount for salad and soups. It serves as well alcohol and some small Brew House craft beers. For non alcoholics, cool yourself down with a dirty lemonade which is not so dirty.",

So I brought along my friends today to try out this restaurant to see if it has lived up the hype! The interior of the place is very casual and definitely great if you\u2019re looking for a dinner place with a group if friends. We ordered a few signature dishes: beef burger with cheese (sides with a delicious and fresh salad), prime flat iron steak (their plating was another spot on!) and another prime steak which was juicy and delicious. We also added a chowder soup, which was rich and with a lot of ingredients inside the soup. The flavor was just right and not too strong like the usual cream soup. Overall, we had a great time and the owner of the shop was also very helper and happy as they kept on serving unlimited fries to each table with a big smile. Hope they continue to succeed as we need more restaurants like this one in Hong Kong!",

All staffs were nice and helpful, they will politely asked customers' needs and refilled fries to us. They also described the steak in detail. We have tried the homemade soup, salad, herbal steak and dessert! The tomato herbal soup was great and healthy; the salad had fresh veggies and yellowish tomatoes with sesame sauce. The medium rare herbal steak was fantastic with soft texture and full of beef taste! Love its simple sauce and sea salt, besides, the whole grilled garlic was soft and lovely taste!\nFries was so crispy and hot with truffle taste. The tomato sauce was added for increasing taste!",

I would recommend the plain flat iron. It is served with unlimited fries by default. If you want some greens, you can add just small amount for salad and soups. It serves as well alcohol and some small Brew House craft beers. For non alcoholics, cool yourself down with a dirty lemonade which is not so dirty.",

So I brought along my friends today to try out this restaurant to see if it has lived up the hype! The interior of the place is very casual and definitely great if you\u2019re looking for a dinner place with a group if friends. We ordered a few signature dishes: beef burger with cheese (sides with a delicious and fresh salad), prime flat iron steak (their plating was another spot on!) and another prime steak which was juicy and delicious. We also added a chowder soup, which was rich and with a lot of ingredients inside the soup. The flavor was just right and not too strong like the usual cream soup. Overall, we had a great time and the owner of the shop was also very helper and happy as they kept on serving unlimited fries to each table with a big smile. Hope they continue to succeed as we need more restaurants like this one in Hong Kong!",

All staffs were nice and helpful, they will politely asked customers' needs and refilled fries to us. They also described the steak in detail. We have tried the homemade soup, salad, herbal steak and dessert! The tomato herbal soup was great and healthy; the salad had fresh veggies and yellowish tomatoes with sesame sauce. The medium rare herbal steak was fantastic with soft texture and full of beef taste! Love its simple sauce and sea salt, besides, the whole grilled garlic was soft and lovely taste!\nFries was so crispy and hot with truffle taste. The tomato sauce was added for increasing taste!",

              "text": "Marvellous price to quality ratio. Similar to flat iron in London, it doesn't serve many different types of steak, but instead manage very well on the type they sell. I would recommend the plain flat iron. It is served with unlimited fries by default. If you want some greens, you can add just small amount for salad and soups. It serves as well alcohol and some small Brew House craft beers. For non alcoholics, cool yourself down with a dirty lemonade which is not so dirty.",

So I brought along my friends today to try out this restaurant to see if it has lived up the hype! The interior of the place is very casual and definitely great if you\u2019re looking for a dinner place with a group if friends. We ordered a few signature dishes: beef burger with cheese (sides with a delicious and fresh salad), prime flat iron steak (their plating was another spot on!) and another prime steak which was juicy and delicious. We also added a chowder soup, which was rich and with a lot of ingredients inside the soup. The flavor was just right and not too strong like the usual cream soup. Overall, we had a great time and the owner of the shop was also very helper and happy as they kept on serving unlimited fries to each table with a big smile. Hope they continue to succeed as we need more restaurants like this one in Hong Kong!",

All staffs were nice and helpful, they will politely asked customers' needs and refilled fries to us. They also described the steak in detail. We have tried the homemade soup, salad, herbal steak and dessert! The tomato herbal soup was great and healthy; the salad had fresh veggies and yellowish tomatoes with sesame sauce. The medium rare herbal steak was fantastic with soft texture and full of beef taste! Love its simple sauce and sea salt, besides, the whole grilled garlic was soft and lovely taste!\nFries was so crispy and hot with truffle taste. The tomato sauce was added for increasing taste!",

I would recommend the plain flat iron. It is served with unlimited fries by default. If you want some greens, you can add just small amount for salad and soups. It serves as well alcohol and some small Brew House craft beers. For non alcoholics, cool yourself down with a dirty lemonade which is not so dirty.",

So I brought along my friends today to try out this restaurant to see if it has lived up the hype! The interior of the place is very casual and definitely great if you\u2019re looking for a dinner place with a group if friends. We ordered a few signature dishes: beef burger with cheese (sides with a delicious and fresh salad), prime flat iron steak (their plating was another spot on!) and another prime steak which was juicy and delicious. We also added a chowder soup, which was rich and with a lot of ingredients inside the soup. The flavor was just right and not too strong like the usual cream soup. Overall, we had a great time and the owner of the shop was also very helper and happy as they kept on serving unlimited fries to each table with a big smile. Hope they continue to succeed as we need more restaurants like this one in Hong Kong!",
