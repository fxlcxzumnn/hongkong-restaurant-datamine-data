You can see from the picture that the restaurant is in a rectangle style and spacey.\nGiven the restaurant has an open kitchen design, the customer will have the chance to interact with not only the waitress but also the chef, both Of them are so nice. \nThe last thing is the food quality - a bit pity to say the food is not as tasty as expected but still have feature like the cheung Sam duck dish. Overall it\u2019s still a nice restaurant.",

          "text": "Relatively new on Third Street, Sai Ying Pun, Cheung Sam Cuisine is a western restaurant run by a family, in which the father is the chef, mother and daughter made really friendly hosts. Dinner menu is really comprehensive, fish, chicken, steak, pork racks, etc. My friend and I did really take some time to decide what to get. I decided to get a set dinner with soup, a main, dessert and drink, and it was really worth it.\n\nDaily cream soup was this pumpkin soup. It was so creamy yet full of pumpkin mash. Yum yum! And it was very filling indeed!\n\nMain was this 11oz Canda pork rack with pommery mustard sauce. I was told that this kind of pork doesn\u2019t need to be well done, 80% or 90% cooked would be the best. So I gave it a try for 90% cooked.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t disappoint! I was actually surprised by how big the rack was! It was very easy to be cut, and the pork was so juicy and delicious! Great ingredients cooked well made a fantastic dish! The sweet potato fries and potato fries were crispy too! We suspected that the little scoop of vegetables on the side was from the minestrone soup, haha! It was good though. Also, the mustard sauce went very well with the pork. Nom nom!\n\nI was very full after finishing the pork rack, so I ordered something light to drink. This lemon honey just made a nice nourishing drink that wasn\u2019t too stuffing.\n\nDaily dessert was either tiramisu or this chocolate dumpling. Since I didn\u2019t know what chocolate dumpling is, I ordered it to try it out. It was a little puff with chocolate custard inside. The puff was served hot so it wasn\u2019t stuffing at all. I was a bit concerned that I might be too full for a dessert, but the saying \u201cdessert goes to another stomach\u201d is so true, and this little puff made an amazing dessert and perfect full stop to this wonderful meal.\n\nIf I would be in this area during lunch time, I would definitely like to try out their lunch menu!",

              "text": "Relatively new on Third Street, Sai Ying Pun, Cheung Sam Cuisine is a western restaurant run by a family, in which the father is the chef, mother and daughter made really friendly hosts. Dinner menu is really comprehensive, fish, chicken, steak, pork racks, etc. My friend and I did really take some time to decide what to get. I decided to get a set dinner with soup, a main, dessert and drink, and it was really worth it.\n\nDaily cream soup was this pumpkin soup. It was so creamy yet full of pumpkin mash. Yum yum! And it was very filling indeed!\n\nMain was this 11oz Canda pork rack with pommery mustard sauce. I was told that this kind of pork doesn\u2019t need to be well done, 80% or 90% cooked would be the best. So I gave it a try for 90% cooked.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t disappoint! I was actually surprised by how big the rack was! It was very easy to be cut, and the pork was so juicy and delicious! Great ingredients cooked well made a fantastic dish! The sweet potato fries and potato fries were crispy too! We suspected that the little scoop of vegetables on the side was from the minestrone soup, haha! It was good though. Also, the mustard sauce went very well with the pork. Nom nom!\n\nI was very full after finishing the pork rack, so I ordered something light to drink. This lemon honey just made a nice nourishing drink that wasn\u2019t too stuffing.\n\nDaily dessert was either tiramisu or this chocolate dumpling. Since I didn\u2019t know what chocolate dumpling is, I ordered it to try it out. It was a little puff with chocolate custard inside. The puff was served hot so it wasn\u2019t stuffing at all. I was a bit concerned that I might be too full for a dessert, but the saying \u201cdessert goes to another stomach\u201d is so true, and this little puff made an amazing dessert and perfect full stop to this wonderful meal.\n\nIf I would be in this area during lunch time, I would definitely like to try out their lunch menu!",

Dinner menu is really comprehensive, fish, chicken, steak, pork racks, etc. My friend and I did really take some time to decide what to get. I decided to get a set dinner with soup, a main, dessert and drink, and it was really worth it.\n\nDaily cream soup was this pumpkin soup. It was so creamy yet full of pumpkin mash. Yum yum! And it was very filling indeed!\n\nMain was this 11oz Canda pork rack with pommery mustard sauce. I was told that this kind of pork doesn\u2019t need to be well done, 80% or 90% cooked would be the best. So I gave it a try for 90% cooked.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t disappoint! I was actually surprised by how big the rack was! It was very easy to be cut, and the pork was so juicy and delicious! Great ingredients cooked well made a fantastic dish! The sweet potato fries and potato fries were crispy too! We suspected that the little scoop of vegetables on the side was from the minestrone soup, haha! It was good though. Also, the mustard sauce went very well with the pork. Nom nom!\n\nI was very full after finishing the pork rack, so I ordered something light to drink. This lemon honey just made a nice nourishing drink that wasn\u2019t too stuffing.\n\nDaily dessert was either tiramisu or this chocolate dumpling. Since I didn\u2019t know what chocolate dumpling is, I ordered it to try it out. It was a little puff with chocolate custard inside. The puff was served hot so it wasn\u2019t stuffing at all. I was a bit concerned that I might be too full for a dessert, but the saying \u201cdessert goes to another stomach\u201d is so true, and this little puff made an amazing dessert and perfect full stop to this wonderful meal.\n\nIf I would be in this area during lunch time, I would definitely like to try out their lunch menu!",

Dinner menu is really comprehensive, fish, chicken, steak, pork racks, etc. My friend and I did really take some time to decide what to get. I decided to get a set dinner with soup, a main, dessert and drink, and it was really worth it.\n\nDaily cream soup was this pumpkin soup. It was so creamy yet full of pumpkin mash. Yum yum! And it was very filling indeed!\n\nMain was this 11oz Canda pork rack with pommery mustard sauce. I was told that this kind of pork doesn\u2019t need to be well done, 80% or 90% cooked would be the best. So I gave it a try for 90% cooked.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t disappoint! I was actually surprised by how big the rack was! It was very easy to be cut, and the pork was so juicy and delicious! Great ingredients cooked well made a fantastic dish! The sweet potato fries and potato fries were crispy too! We suspected that the little scoop of vegetables on the side was from the minestrone soup, haha! It was good though. Also, the mustard sauce went very well with the pork. Nom nom!\n\nI was very full after finishing the pork rack, so I ordered something light to drink. This lemon honey just made a nice nourishing drink that wasn\u2019t too stuffing.\n\nDaily dessert was either tiramisu or this chocolate dumpling. Since I didn\u2019t know what chocolate dumpling is, I ordered it to try it out. It was a little puff with chocolate custard inside. The puff was served hot so it wasn\u2019t stuffing at all. I was a bit concerned that I might be too full for a dessert, but the saying \u201cdessert goes to another stomach\u201d is so true, and this little puff made an amazing dessert and perfect full stop to this wonderful meal.\n\nIf I would be in this area during lunch time, I would definitely like to try out their lunch menu!",
