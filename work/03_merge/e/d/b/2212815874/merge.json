          "text": "Having been to the old place before they moved, I totally did not expect to have such a disappointing experience.\n\nFirst up, the place was huge, and the sushi bar could sit at least 17 people. Whereas other sushi bars have an almost comical crowding of sushi chefs behind the bar, there were only 3 chefs that night. The sushi bar was pretty much full so the omakase of ~10 pieces of sushi took THREE HOURS. This was definitely a first for me, and most omakase (at least in HK) take an hour maximum two. And it wasn't because we weren't eating quickly - we ate the sushi once the chef placed it down. It took so long that it actually went over my complimentary parking with Lee Gardens. Even Lee Gardens didn't expect anyone eating there to need more than 3 hours. \n\nThe sashimi cuts were tiny, and the sushi quality was just okay. The shocking part was THEY LEFT A BIG PIECE OF BONE IN MY SUSHI. It was at least 2cm long, lodged in my piece of kinmedai. I almost choked on it and had to spit the whole sushi out on a napkin. The staff promptly took my napkin and gave it to the sushi chefs who dissected my partially chewed sushi at the sushi bar right in front of us. I guess they did not believe me? Obviously they found the bone so they compensated by simply replacing that one piece of sushi. The chef even tried to defend himself and say these things happen. Well, no, this kind of amateur mistake is not expected to happen when you're paying $1500 for an omakase. \n\nThe chef also swaped out my maki (listed as a course in their omakase menu) to one piece of sushi (ironically that piece of kinmedai) without telling us until I asked why the maki is missing. The chef said guests are usually full so they just change it - well he never asked and I would have preferred the maki to that piece of sushi with bones. \n\nOn a smaller note, I'm a lefty and chefs usually tilt the piece of sushi to the left to make it easier for me to pick it up. Handy way to see if the chef is actually being attentive and well, this chef didn't bother throughout the whole meal. \n\nPlenty of sushi bars in Causeway Bay, this one is at the bottom.",

My sashimi comes in a bamboo box, the box has black mould on it and when I have done eating only I realised it has green mould on the cover too. The Kaiseki sashimi box comes with a cook eel, cold eel blanch in water full of bones. I had to spit it out ... can\u2019t possibly debone it. Coz so many of them !! The grill dish was another big head prawn, over cooked and chewy. The head is sooo big but hardly anything to eat ! Sushi, the rice texture was not right and too much vinegar. Best thing was the onzen egg cold noodle tonight l! For a set which cost over a thousand, the portion and quality are not right. Booked for friends\u2019 bday. Ended up all came out with huge disappointment. Sorry no more business from us !!",

              "text": "Having been to the old place before they moved, I totally did not expect to have such a disappointing experience.\n\nFirst up, the place was huge, and the sushi bar could sit at least 17 people. Whereas other sushi bars have an almost comical crowding of sushi chefs behind the bar, there were only 3 chefs that night. The sushi bar was pretty much full so the omakase of ~10 pieces of sushi took THREE HOURS. This was definitely a first for me, and most omakase (at least in HK) take an hour maximum two. And it wasn't because we weren't eating quickly - we ate the sushi once the chef placed it down. It took so long that it actually went over my complimentary parking with Lee Gardens. Even Lee Gardens didn't expect anyone eating there to need more than 3 hours. \n\nThe sashimi cuts were tiny, and the sushi quality was just okay. The shocking part was THEY LEFT A BIG PIECE OF BONE IN MY SUSHI. It was at least 2cm long, lodged in my piece of kinmedai. I almost choked on it and had to spit the whole sushi out on a napkin. The staff promptly took my napkin and gave it to the sushi chefs who dissected my partially chewed sushi at the sushi bar right in front of us. I guess they did not believe me? Obviously they found the bone so they compensated by simply replacing that one piece of sushi. The chef even tried to defend himself and say these things happen. Well, no, this kind of amateur mistake is not expected to happen when you're paying $1500 for an omakase. \n\nThe chef also swaped out my maki (listed as a course in their omakase menu) to one piece of sushi (ironically that piece of kinmedai) without telling us until I asked why the maki is missing. The chef said guests are usually full so they just change it - well he never asked and I would have preferred the maki to that piece of sushi with bones. \n\nOn a smaller note, I'm a lefty and chefs usually tilt the piece of sushi to the left to make it easier for me to pick it up. Handy way to see if the chef is actually being attentive and well, this chef didn't bother throughout the whole meal. \n\nPlenty of sushi bars in Causeway Bay, this one is at the bottom.",

My sashimi comes in a bamboo box, the box has black mould on it and when I have done eating only I realised it has green mould on the cover too. The Kaiseki sashimi box comes with a cook eel, cold eel blanch in water full of bones. I had to spit it out ... can\u2019t possibly debone it. Coz so many of them !! The grill dish was another big head prawn, over cooked and chewy. The head is sooo big but hardly anything to eat ! Sushi, the rice texture was not right and too much vinegar. Best thing was the onzen egg cold noodle tonight l! For a set which cost over a thousand, the portion and quality are not right. Booked for friends\u2019 bday.

Whereas other sushi bars have an almost comical crowding of sushi chefs behind the bar, there were only 3 chefs that night. The sushi bar was pretty much full so the omakase of ~10 pieces of sushi took THREE HOURS. This was definitely a first for me, and most omakase (at least in HK) take an hour maximum two. And it wasn't because we weren't eating quickly - we ate the sushi once the chef placed it down. It took so long that it actually went over my complimentary parking with Lee Gardens. Even Lee Gardens didn't expect anyone eating there to need more than 3 hours. \n\nThe sashimi cuts were tiny, and the sushi quality was just okay. The shocking part was THEY LEFT A BIG PIECE OF BONE IN MY SUSHI. It was at least 2cm long, lodged in my piece of kinmedai. I almost choked on it and had to spit the whole sushi out on a napkin. The staff promptly took my napkin and gave it to the sushi chefs who dissected my partially chewed sushi at the sushi bar right in front of us. I guess they did not believe me? Obviously they found the bone so they compensated by simply replacing that one piece of sushi. The chef even tried to defend himself and say these things happen. Well, no, this kind of amateur mistake is not expected to happen when you're paying $1500 for an omakase. \n\nThe chef also swaped out my maki (listed as a course in their omakase menu) to one piece of sushi (ironically that piece of kinmedai) without telling us until I asked why the maki is missing. The chef said guests are usually full so they just change it - well he never asked and I would have preferred the maki to that piece of sushi with bones. \n\nOn a smaller note, I'm a lefty and chefs usually tilt the piece of sushi to the left to make it easier for me to pick it up. Handy way to see if the chef is actually being attentive and well, this chef didn't bother throughout the whole meal. \n\nPlenty of sushi bars in Causeway Bay, this one is at the bottom.",

My sashimi comes in a bamboo box, the box has black mould on it and when I have done eating only I realised it has green mould on the cover too. The Kaiseki sashimi box comes with a cook eel, cold eel blanch in water full of bones. I had to spit it out ... can\u2019t possibly debone it. Coz so many of them !! The grill dish was another big head prawn, over cooked and chewy. The head is sooo big but hardly anything to eat ! Sushi, the rice texture was not right and too much vinegar. Best thing was the onzen egg cold noodle tonight l! For a set which cost over a thousand, the portion and quality are not right. Booked for friends\u2019 bday. Ended up all came out with huge disappointment. Sorry no more business from us !!",

          "text": "Having been to the old place before they moved, I totally did not expect to have such a disappointing experience.\n\nFirst up, the place was huge, and the sushi bar could sit at least 17 people. Whereas other sushi bars have an almost comical crowding of sushi chefs behind the bar, there were only 3 chefs that night. The sushi bar was pretty much full so the omakase of ~10 pieces of sushi took THREE HOURS. This was definitely a first for me, and most omakase (at least in HK) take an hour maximum two. And it wasn't because we weren't eating quickly - we ate the sushi once the chef placed it down. It took so long that it actually went over my complimentary parking with Lee Gardens. Even Lee Gardens didn't expect anyone eating there to need more than 3 hours. \n\nThe sashimi cuts were tiny, and the sushi quality was just okay. The shocking part was THEY LEFT A BIG PIECE OF BONE IN MY SUSHI. It was at least 2cm long, lodged in my piece of kinmedai. I almost choked on it and had to spit the whole sushi out on a napkin. The staff promptly took my napkin and gave it to the sushi chefs who dissected my partially chewed sushi at the sushi bar right in front of us. I guess they did not believe me? Obviously they found the bone so they compensated by simply replacing that one piece of sushi. The chef even tried to defend himself and say these things happen. Well, no, this kind of amateur mistake is not expected to happen when you're paying $1500 for an omakase. \n\nThe chef also swaped out my maki (listed as a course in their omakase menu) to one piece of sushi (ironically that piece of kinmedai) without telling us until I asked why the maki is missing. The chef said guests are usually full so they just change it - well he never asked and I would have preferred the maki to that piece of sushi with bones. \n\nOn a smaller note, I'm a lefty and chefs usually tilt the piece of sushi to the left to make it easier for me to pick it up. Handy way to see if the chef is actually being attentive and well, this chef didn't bother throughout the whole meal. \n\nPlenty of sushi bars in Causeway Bay, this one is at the bottom.",

My sashimi comes in a bamboo box, the box has black mould on it and when I have done eating only I realised it has green mould on the cover too. The Kaiseki sashimi box comes with a cook eel, cold eel blanch in water full of bones. I had to spit it out ... can\u2019t possibly debone it. Coz so many of them !! The grill dish was another big head prawn, over cooked and chewy. The head is sooo big but hardly anything to eat ! Sushi, the rice texture was not right and too much vinegar. Best thing was the onzen egg cold noodle tonight l! For a set which cost over a thousand, the portion and quality are not right. Booked for friends\u2019 bday. Ended up all came out with huge disappointment. Sorry no more business from us !!",
