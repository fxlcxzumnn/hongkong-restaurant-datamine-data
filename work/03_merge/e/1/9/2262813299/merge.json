          "text": "Colleague had been craving for a big meal (buffet) for quite some time, and both of us did not want something too heavy after all the Chinese New Year feasts, therefore, we decided to try My Meat Run Buddy for their well-known vegetarian dinner buffet.\n\nMy Meat Run Buddy has a really nice interior design. We were seated at the bar table facing the street, which was quite chill and cozy, as well as close to the food tables.\n\nWe had to pay in advanced, which is fair for the restaurant to make sure that people show up for their bookings in order not to waste food. We were given this ticket on the cute hedgehog to enter.\n\nThere was a wide variety of vegetarian and vegan food, both Chinese and western style. First round with a full plate, as there were so many things on the food table that I wanted to try. All of them were really delicious, and they were not oily at all, as traditional vegetarian food is always cooked with lots of oil and seasonings to give the food flavour in order to make up for meatless. Dessert was a great surprise, as there was yummy tiramisu and cheesecake! Colleague said tofu dessert was great too!\n\nFood was fresh as the turn over rate was high, and there were new dishes from the kitchen from time to time. \n\nDefinitely would visit again for the great food and positive diet mentality.",

We were seated at the bar table facing the street, which was quite chill and cozy, as well as close to the food tables.\n\nWe had to pay in advanced, which is fair for the restaurant to make sure that people show up for their bookings in order not to waste food. We were given this ticket on the cute hedgehog to enter.\n\nThere was a wide variety of vegetarian and vegan food, both Chinese and western style. First round with a full plate, as there were so many things on the food table that I wanted to try. All of them were really delicious, and they were not oily at all, as traditional vegetarian food is always cooked with lots of oil and seasonings to give the food flavour in order to make up for meatless. Dessert was a great surprise, as there was yummy tiramisu and cheesecake! Colleague said tofu dessert was great too!\n\nFood was fresh as the turn over rate was high, and there were new dishes from the kitchen from time to time. \n\nDefinitely would visit again for the great food and positive diet mentality.",
