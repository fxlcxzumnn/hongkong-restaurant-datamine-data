I arrived with a friend, we were both well dressed, no trainers as we were supposed to have drinks after in a nice cocktail bar. We arrived around 6:30 pm, the entrance hostess told me it was fully booked but she was going to call me if any booking is cancelled. It was fine for me. Barely 5 min after she called me telling me there was a table available, but it was on the terrace, and we would prefer inside. She phoned again a few minute later telling us there was a table free inside. My surprise was that even it was a Saturday evening, the entire time we stayed at the venue there was many empty tables empty. I asked the staff inside who told me they were not fully booked at all. So why treating us like this? The service was the most annoying and boring, they had to explain to us a whole non sense story about pizza. I went to Italy and ate pizza before (my previous reviews might attest to it), and pizza is pizza. I didn\u2019t find anything particular which justify such high price for some dough and ingredients. I will never go for sure.",

They collaborate with the world famous pizza master Franco Pepe to elaborate next level pizzas. The high quality gourmet pizzas they propose are delicious, innovative and will surprise all your senses.

              "text": "Randomly picked Runway for a reunion dinner with my travel buddies, as it\u2019s at a convenient location for all four of us.\n\nWe kicked start the dinner with two platters of wings. The wings were served fresh hot, and they were spicy even without the hot sauce on the side. I love the crispy skin, which wrapped juicy chicken meat underneath. Yum!\n\nCheese nachos were great too! They were not ordinary nachos crisps that you could get from supermarket, but legit thick ones. Crunchy, and cheese was smeared in between the nachos. The sour cream was great too! As for the brown sauce, we thought it\u2019s something like hummus? Only complain is, the portion was a bit small for four people, and we finished the whole plate really quickly.\n\nI requested for these mini burgers, and they were awesome! Buns were crunchy! We could hear some cracking sound when we cut the buns to share. The beef patties were very thick and juicy too! So delicious!\n\nWe saw attractive photo of these beef cubes looping on restaurant display, which got us to order one to try, and it did not disappoint! You could see the steam coming out of the hot plate in the photo! And the beef cubes were cooked right to the point, not too chewy, but quite tender and juicy indeed. The bell peppers made great seasoning and sides.\n\nThis carbonara might be ordinary, but it\u2019s a great dish to share among the four of us. The creamy white sauce was so satisfying with the al dente spaghetti. Not to mention our all time comfort food - fatty bacon strips!\n\nWe ended the meal with Fish n Chips. Hum\u2026I was expecting legit fish, not these fish fingers\u2026Oh well, these fish fingers tasted good, but a bit too salty as there was salt sprinkled on top\u2026Thin fries were gone really soon, they are always popular.\n\nWe also got some beer with Happy Hour deal (buy one get one free). And some of my friends were really interested in shisha. We might as well visit again during weekend to try out the nice smelling shisha.",

The wings were served fresh hot, and they were spicy even without the hot sauce on the side. I love the crispy skin, which wrapped juicy chicken meat underneath. Yum!\n\nCheese nachos were great too! They were not ordinary nachos crisps that you could get from supermarket, but legit thick ones. Crunchy, and cheese was smeared in between the nachos. The sour cream was great too! As for the brown sauce, we thought it\u2019s something like hummus? Only complain is, the portion was a bit small for four people, and we finished the whole plate really quickly.\n\nI requested for these mini burgers, and they were awesome! Buns were crunchy! We could hear some cracking sound when we cut the buns to share. The beef patties were very thick and juicy too! So delicious!\n\nWe saw attractive photo of these beef cubes looping on restaurant display, which got us to order one to try, and it did not disappoint! You could see the steam coming out of the hot plate in the photo! And the beef cubes were cooked right to the point, not too chewy, but quite tender and juicy indeed. The bell peppers made great seasoning and sides.\n\nThis carbonara might be ordinary, but it\u2019s a great dish to share among the four of us. The creamy white sauce was so satisfying with the al dente spaghetti. Not to mention our all time comfort food - fatty bacon strips!\n\nWe ended the meal with Fish n Chips. Hum\u2026I was expecting legit fish, not these fish fingers\u2026Oh well, these fish fingers tasted good, but a bit too salty as there was salt sprinkled on top\u2026Thin fries were gone really soon, they are always popular.\n\nWe also got some beer with Happy Hour deal (buy one get one free). And some of my friends were really interested in shisha. We might as well visit again during weekend to try out the nice smelling shisha.",

I arrived with a friend, we were both well dressed, no trainers as we were supposed to have drinks after in a nice cocktail bar. We arrived around 6:30 pm, the entrance hostess told me it was fully booked but she was going to call me if any booking is cancelled. It was fine for me. Barely 5 min after she called me telling me there was a table available, but it was on the terrace, and we would prefer inside. She phoned again a few minute later telling us there was a table free inside. My surprise was that even it was a Saturday evening, the entire time we stayed at the venue there was many empty tables empty. I asked the staff inside who told me they were not fully booked at all. So why treating us like this? The service was the most annoying and boring, they had to explain to us a whole non sense story about pizza. I went to Italy and ate pizza before (my previous reviews might attest to it), and pizza is pizza. I didn\u2019t find anything particular which justify such high price for some dough and ingredients. I will never go for sure.",

I arrived with a friend, we were both well dressed, no trainers as we were supposed to have drinks after in a nice cocktail bar. We arrived around 6:30 pm, the entrance hostess told me it was fully booked but she was going to call me if any booking is cancelled. It was fine for me. Barely 5 min after she called me telling me there was a table available, but it was on the terrace, and we would prefer inside. She phoned again a few minute later telling us there was a table free inside. My surprise was that even it was a Saturday evening, the entire time we stayed at the venue there was many empty tables empty. I asked the staff inside who told me they were not fully booked at all. So why treating us like this? The service was the most annoying and boring, they had to explain to us a whole non sense story about pizza. I went to Italy and ate pizza before (my previous reviews might attest to it), and pizza is pizza. I didn\u2019t find anything particular which justify such high price for some dough and ingredients. I will never go for sure.",

I arrived with a friend, we were both well dressed, no trainers as we were supposed to have drinks after in a nice cocktail bar. We arrived around 6:30 pm, the entrance hostess told me it was fully booked but she was going to call me if any booking is cancelled. It was fine for me. Barely 5 min after she called me telling me there was a table available, but it was on the terrace, and we would prefer inside. She phoned again a few minute later telling us there was a table free inside. My surprise was that even it was a Saturday evening, the entire time we stayed at the venue there was many empty tables empty. I asked the staff inside who told me they were not fully booked at all. So why treating us like this? The service was the most annoying and boring, they had to explain to us a whole non sense story about pizza. I went to Italy and ate pizza before (my previous reviews might attest to it), and pizza is pizza. I didn\u2019t find anything particular which justify such high price for some dough and ingredients. I will never go for sure.",
