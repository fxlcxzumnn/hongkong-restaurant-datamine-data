Adding chilli oil couldn't even help. Girlfriend got chicken and rice. Rice came on the side and didn't taste fresh. Like they made it in the morning and sat for so many hours. Chicken was 2 - 3 pieces with a LOT of garlic to hide it and peppers and onions. On top of that bill was way too high. You can find high quality HK cusine in downtown for half the price... sigh. \n\nHope customers review this place before deciding to eat!",

Adding chilli oil couldn't even help. Girlfriend got chicken and rice. Rice came on the side and didn't taste fresh. Like they made it in the morning and sat for so many hours. Chicken was 2 - 3 pieces with a LOT of garlic to hide it and peppers and onions. On top of that bill was way too high. You can find high quality HK cusine in downtown for half the price... sigh. \n\nHope customers review this place before deciding to eat!",
