We tried the tasting menu (600 HKD/person) which was actually a lot of food - maybe too much - but the staff didn\u2019t actually describe what the dishes were as they served them which immediately took away from the overall experience. Service was also very slow and we had to get up and get their attention three times over the course of the night. We were in the back room, but they had plenty of staff and weren\u2019t busy so there\u2019s no excuse for not having a waiter check in regularly over the course of the meal for additional drinks, the check, etc. On the plus side, the cocktails were refreshing and the venue is nice.",

We were waiting for another friend to come and have ordered the food but then once our friend arrived (30 mins later), they came to us and asked what to order.\n\n Also, since this is still a pop up restaurant, I guess they're still testing the market for Burmese food. But the staff made no effort to explain the menu. There were only our table and another table when we were there but the staff were lazing around and chatting in the counter. Can't believe that they can't give attentive service even though there were only two tables.",

We tried the tasting menu (600 HKD/person) which was actually a lot of food - maybe too much - but the staff didn\u2019t actually describe what the dishes were as they served them which immediately took away from the overall experience. Service was also very slow and we had to get up and get their attention three times over the course of the night. We were in the back room, but they had plenty of staff and weren\u2019t busy so there\u2019s no excuse for not having a waiter check in regularly over the course of the meal for additional drinks, the check, etc. On the plus side, the cocktails were refreshing and the venue is nice.",

We were waiting for another friend to come and have ordered the food but then once our friend arrived (30 mins later), they came to us and asked what to order.\n\n Also, since this is still a pop up restaurant, I guess they're still testing the market for Burmese food. But the staff made no effort to explain the menu. There were only our table and another table when we were there but the staff were lazing around and chatting in the counter.
