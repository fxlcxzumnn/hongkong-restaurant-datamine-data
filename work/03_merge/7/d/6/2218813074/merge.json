I feel good shopping in Green Common as they promote a conscious consuming habits, such as being eco-friendly, as well as going green to be nice to environment and animals.\n\nKind Kitchen operates with this core elements - be kind to animals when you eat. There are many reasons to go green, and stopping animal cruelty could be one of them. Kind Kitchen offers a nice alternative to meat with its plant-based substitutes, such as Beyond Meat from USA and OmiPork. I am a fans of Beyond Meat, as it tastes so much like real beef, yet it\u2019s harmless to animals and environment, and healthier than ordinary beef with less cholesterol and more dietary fibers. \n\nThis Deluxe Burger I ordered is massive! I love the Beyond Meat patty so much! It\u2019s so juicy and flavoured. Seriously, I can\u2019t tell how different it is from real beef patty. The truffle sauce is gorgeous and goes so well with the burger. I wish there were more so that I can dip the fries in it. Also, the bits and pieces of mushroom top up the whole burger quite a lot.\n\nThe fries were freshly fried, hot and crispy. Yum Yum!",

          "text": "Kind Kitchen is an okay effort from the Green Common team to upscale its usual offerings. \n\nThe menu is quite impressive in its offerings, but don\u2019t expect to be blown away by the taste of anything. We\u2019ve been here a few times now, and most dishes have been disappointing.\n\nWe took advantage of the Thankful Week offer (50% off Beyond Meat menu items) and had a nice meal. We\u2019d tried the Deluxe Beyond Truffle Burger before and knew to avoid that - it\u2019s quite literally just a Beyond patty with a dollop of truffle sauce on top, so nothing mind blowing. We went for the double Beyond cheeseburger, which was tasty.\n\nService was poor. We struggled to get anyone\u2019s attention for long periods and was never able to order from our table; we always had to approach a staff member and ask to order. \n\nThe worst part of this is that after we\u2019d finished our burgers and ordered coffee (which is great by the way), no one came to clear our table. Even when they brought our coffee to us and saw our empty plates, nothing was cleared. When you\u2019re paying a 10% service charge, you expect some actual service.\n\nOverall, an okay experience and the menu gives you the opportunity to try a range of mock meat/dairy products that are quickly making a vegan diet more accessible to the masses. \n\nBut the standard Green Common restaurants offer nearly just as much for a lot less. Our bill would have been a difficult-to-swallow $450 without the Thankful Week 50% off; instead we paid $270, which seemed more appropriate for the quality.",

I feel good shopping in Green Common as they promote a conscious consuming habits, such as being eco-friendly, as well as going green to be nice to environment and animals.\n\nKind Kitchen operates with this core elements - be kind to animals when you eat. There are many reasons to go green, and stopping animal cruelty could be one of them. Kind Kitchen offers a nice alternative to meat with its plant-based substitutes, such as Beyond Meat from USA and OmiPork. I am a fans of Beyond Meat, as it tastes so much like real beef, yet it\u2019s harmless to animals and environment, and healthier than ordinary beef with less cholesterol and more dietary fibers. \n\nThis Deluxe Burger I ordered is massive! I love the Beyond Meat patty so much! It\u2019s so juicy and flavoured. Seriously, I can\u2019t tell how different it is from real beef patty. The truffle sauce is gorgeous and goes so well with the burger. I wish there were more so that I can dip the fries in it. Also, the bits and pieces of mushroom top up the whole burger quite a lot.\n\nThe fries were freshly fried, hot and crispy. Yum Yum!",

          "text": "Kind Kitchen is an okay effort from the Green Common team to upscale its usual offerings. \n\nThe menu is quite impressive in its offerings, but don\u2019t expect to be blown away by the taste of anything. We\u2019ve been here a few times now, and most dishes have been disappointing.\n\nWe took advantage of the Thankful Week offer (50% off Beyond Meat menu items) and had a nice meal. We\u2019d tried the Deluxe Beyond Truffle Burger before and knew to avoid that - it\u2019s quite literally just a Beyond patty with a dollop of truffle sauce on top, so nothing mind blowing. We went for the double Beyond cheeseburger, which was tasty.\n\nService was poor. We struggled to get anyone\u2019s attention for long periods and was never able to order from our table; we always had to approach a staff member and ask to order. \n\nThe worst part of this is that after we\u2019d finished our burgers and ordered coffee (which is great by the way), no one came to clear our table. Even when they brought our coffee to us and saw our empty plates, nothing was cleared. When you\u2019re paying a 10% service charge, you expect some actual service.\n\nOverall, an okay experience and the menu gives you the opportunity to try a range of mock meat/dairy products that are quickly making a vegan diet more accessible to the masses. \n\nBut the standard Green Common restaurants offer nearly just as much for a lot less. Our bill would have been a difficult-to-swallow $450 without the Thankful Week 50% off; instead we paid $270, which seemed more appropriate for the quality.",
