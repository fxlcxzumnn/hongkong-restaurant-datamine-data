I'd recommend you to watch 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi' before coming here as you will have a deeper understanding and respect for the food.  One star less than 5 because the octopus is no longer included in the set but is an extra charge.  For the amount of money, they should include it again. Tip: eat the sushi with your hands and not with chopsticks; it enhances the authentic experience.  Also, stick to lunch as it's better value than dinner I reckon.",

          "text": "Can understand why a 3* Michelin can be 50% full for a 2nd seating... \n\nCame here for a friends special bday and made bookings in advance. Friend arrived at 8:15 but was told the table wasn\u2019t ready until 8:30. At 8:30 we asked again and they said 1 more minute but then they sat us down around 8:40, after the guests left and they cleaned up. Head chef greets guests at the door as they leave to hand out business cards.\n\nLucky for me I had good company otherwise it\u2019d be a tough dinner to sit through. \n\nFood was great! Abalone signature was top in terms of flavour, tenderness and freshness. Baby snapper was really delicate and refreshing. Two types of sea urchin was also a hit as the uni was really fresh. \n\nThe red vinegar traditional rice is good but also a bit pungent and takes away from the seafood flavour. Didn\u2019t have to add any sauce but you will find your mouth lined with a vinaigrette tang. \n\nOtoro had tendon so literally impossible to melt in your mouth. We wanted to order a 720 ML sake and asked for advise but all we got was it\u2019s dry / sweet or should be drank cold best. No depth to the origin of the sake, or any key unique features and for any bottles of sake prices 1,200 -15,000 you would really expect a bit more. At least a suggestion on why this sake goes well with the omakase. \n\nSo why 1*? I\u2019m not a food critic and I\u2019m not a chef so my opinions are solely based on my personal taste and preference of what I would expect from a 3* institution. \n\nKey observations / feeling: \n- Two local servers were friendliest throughout the night but were also hard sellers:\n- always resorted to the higher priced menu items without even asking for preference / background \n- asked if you wanted to add more food without asking if you were full \n- language , spoke in Cantonese and described every dish to us , assume if you didn\u2019t speak their language it would have been English instead \n- Head chef didn\u2019t introduce himself at all nor did he have any interest to engage with his customers ( our party of 2 nor the party of 2 beside us) \n- for an Omakase with 5 applies and 8 pieces of sushi, we had to wolf it all down in 70 mins \n- we gave feedback to the server that food was too rushed and rather than taking accountability, she said: \u201cit\u2019s because there\u2019s only 4 customers today so the serving time is quicker \u201c ... my friend even said: shouldn\u2019t you guys have food timing figured out in advance , especially when you knew we would be four ppl... \n- had to ask for them to hold off desert as we still had 360mL of our sake left... and that we could digest our food a bit \n\nDrum roll Dealbreaker: \nAt least 10:35 we (my friend and I and the party of 2 beside us) were asked by the Head chef-San that they were about to close... and that he hinted we should leave. 0 reminders or mentioning of closing time or seating limit especially when we were sat in later. We still had 2 final glasses of sake to finish so quickly drank it the 4 of us took the hint and left. Head chef did a quick greet by the door but surprise : no business cards and no dialogue. \n\nIf you need to check off a 3* Michelin off your bucket list, best to put this last on your list. \n\nDidn\u2019t take photos as we were there for the experience and not the show.",

I'd recommend you to watch 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi' before coming here as you will have a deeper understanding and respect for the food.  One star less than 5 because the octopus is no longer included in the set but is an extra charge.  For the amount of money, they should include it again. Tip: eat the sushi with your hands and not with chopsticks; it enhances the authentic experience.  Also, stick to lunch as it's better value than dinner I reckon.",
