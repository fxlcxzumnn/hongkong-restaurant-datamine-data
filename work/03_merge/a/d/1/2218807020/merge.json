Food was delivered in under 10 mins, even at the height of the lunch hour.\n\nI enjoyed 'The Burger', which is a Beyond Meat product, with purple yam chips and a tasty dipping sauce. The food was well made and tasty. However, at HK$145 for a vegetarian burger, it is a little more steeply priced than I prefer.",

When we arrived a waiter put a jug of water on the table then never came back, when we motioned to him we were ready to order he motioned back to order at the till. No mention of that when we arrived. The food arrived but no cutlery or napkins or glasses we had to get them ourselves. That\u2019s fine but why not let your guests know when they arrive?\nThank you for your explanation. When we first visited we were greeted by a delightful woman, (possibly the owner?) who talked us through the menu and specials that day. I\u2019m sure your regular visitors don\u2019t necessarily need or want that service but it could be nice for first time visitors to be given an explanation of how the restaurant works and what the special is, etc. We didn\u2019t see the signs telling us everything was self service. The first real interaction we had with the staff was when our plates were cleared and we were asked if everything had been ok.",

Food was delivered in under 10 mins, even at the height of the lunch hour.\n\nI enjoyed 'The Burger', which is a Beyond Meat product, with purple yam chips and a tasty dipping sauce. The food was well made and tasty. However, at HK$145 for a vegetarian burger, it is a little more steeply priced than I prefer.",

My favorite one is fried tofu and scrambled eggs, and the sauces are very delicious (seems like they make their own sauces).\n\nvisit date: 2018-08",

When we arrived a waiter put a jug of water on the table then never came back, when we motioned to him we were ready to order he motioned back to order at the till. No mention of that when we arrived. The food arrived but no cutlery or napkins or glasses we had to get them ourselves. That\u2019s fine but why not let your guests know when they arrive?\nThank you for your explanation. When we first visited we were greeted by a delightful woman, (possibly the owner?) who talked us through the menu and specials that day. I\u2019m sure your regular visitors don\u2019t necessarily need or want that service but it could be nice for first time visitors to be given an explanation of how the restaurant works and what the special is, etc. We didn\u2019t see the signs telling us everything was self service. The first real interaction we had with the staff was when our plates were cleared and we were asked if everything had been ok.",
