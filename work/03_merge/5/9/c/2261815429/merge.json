Wide range of food and drinks selection, everything looked amazing, and turned out that way too! Food seasoned well and sashimi as fresh as you can get.\n\nIt was a birthday celebration and so requested a birthday dessert when I made the reservation, staff was really attentive, knowing exactly when to bring the cake. No awkward moments of knowing there will be a little surprise coming along but having to wait for it and then pretending to be really surprise when you see it, let\u2019s face it, it happens too often! Beautiful writing in gold (edible I assume?) dust on the dessert plate too. \n\nWe were seated near the window side next to their outdoor seating area, view of the harbour would have been better if it wasn\u2019t raining that night but that\u2019s my only complain of the night really.",

I actually love the location and window seat view of the harbour. \n\nNevertheless, staff need to be trained better, just because we didn't order the most expensive dishes from the menu, the staff gave us a bad attitude when we were paying the bill (we still paid around $2300 for 4people), she did not say a single word of thank you and she did not stand next the person who had the bill, instead she shout across the table and say \"over here\" to the payer, with a straight face. We believe this was not professional at all. (bare in mind the service fee was charged at 10% of the bill)\n\nAdditionally, staff was chatting to each other loudly and laughing when we were asking for assistance. Overall if you are looking for a high end experience, there are plenty other options with less the price and better customer service.",

Wide range of food and drinks selection, everything looked amazing, and turned out that way too! Food seasoned well and sashimi as fresh as you can get.\n\nIt was a birthday celebration and so requested a birthday dessert when I made the reservation, staff was really attentive, knowing exactly when to bring the cake. No awkward moments of knowing there will be a little surprise coming along but having to wait for it and then pretending to be really surprise when you see it, let\u2019s face it, it happens too often! Beautiful writing in gold (edible I assume?) dust on the dessert plate too. \n\nWe were seated near the window side next to their outdoor seating area, view of the harbour would have been better if it wasn\u2019t raining that night but that\u2019s my only complain of the night really.",

I actually love the location and window seat view of the harbour. \n\nNevertheless, staff need to be trained better, just because we didn't order the most expensive dishes from the menu, the staff gave us a bad attitude when we were paying the bill (we still paid around $2300 for 4people), she did not say a single word of thank you and she did not stand next the person who had the bill, instead she shout across the table and say \"over here\" to the payer, with a straight face. We believe this was not professional at all. (bare in mind the service fee was charged at 10% of the bill)\n\nAdditionally, staff was chatting to each other loudly and laughing when we were asking for assistance. Overall if you are looking for a high end experience, there are plenty other options with less the price and better customer service.",
