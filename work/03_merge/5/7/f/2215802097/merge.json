Good portions and prices are decent for this area, since it costs $60 just to get mediocre lunch at the open-air market place or $80 for a nice bowl of noodles in a nicely renovated, air conditioned and clean restaurant. The place is usually busy but still has some seats available because a lot of people order take out. I would definitely come back here again.",

We were in group of 6 and would like a more spacious table as we have bags and laptops. Staff forced us to switch from table to table and we were asked to sit with other customers. Apparently we were here beyond lunch peak period where it had only 2 to 3 customers. We will not come again next time and would rather go further place for lunch",

          "text": "Revisited for lunch after 2 years as passing by after work. Lunch was not as good as 2 years ago anymore. Staff attitude was poor. We were in group of 6 and would like a more spacious table as we have bags and laptops. Staff forced us to switch from table to table and we were asked to sit with other customers. Apparently we were here beyond lunch peak period where it had only 2 to 3 customers. We will not come again next time and would rather go further place for lunch",

Mentioned to the staff to use less, but they say the boss wants it like that and laughed.  Very disappointing to see they care so little about something so easily improved.  Maybe the boss doesn't like the planet but the rest of us do.  Please change this!",
