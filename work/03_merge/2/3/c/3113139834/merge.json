I reminded her that Belvedere is a vodka, not a gin.  The person in charge, came over and said that that, Belvedere it's a premium vodka,  they charge extra for it. I told the person in charge that the waitress said it was no change in the price if I ordered Belvedere, and I didn't even receive the vodka that I ordered.  She took the $10 off the tab and apologise. But I was very upset that I ordered a certain vodka at a price that I was told I was going to get, didn't get it and didn't get the vodka I ordered. I had to argue with the staff to get the price changed and remind them what liquor Belvedere was. At the end they were very apologetic and very courteous to me. On a positive note, I love they use last straw, straws. Paper straws are great to see at a bar. And I'm happy to see them fundraising for a charity, just some information about it would be great.",

To sum up, there was a drink I wanted with Belvedere and the house vodka was Absolute. I asked how much extra for Belvedere and the waitress told me there was no upcharge, after confirming with the bar tender. I said OK that's fine, watching the bartender mix my drink she used another vodka besides Belvedere. When I got the check there was an extra $10 up charge for the vodka. And a $1 charge for charity, that I had no clue about it asked if I wanted to donate money.  I asked the waitress why there was an up charge for that vodka. She told me that it's a premium gin. I reminded her that Belvedere is a vodka, not a gin.  The person in charge, came over and said that that, Belvedere it's a premium vodka,  they charge extra for it. I told the person in charge that the waitress said it was no change in the price if I ordered Belvedere, and I didn't even receive the vodka that I ordered.  She took the $10 off the tab and apologise. But I was very upset that I ordered a certain vodka at a price that I was told I was going to get, didn't get it and didn't get the vodka I ordered. I had to argue with the staff to get the price changed and remind them what liquor Belvedere was. At the end they were very apologetic and very courteous to me. On a positive note, I love they use last straw, straws. Paper straws are great to see at a bar. And I'm happy to see them fundraising for a charity, just some information about it would be great.",

          "text": "Saw this place on line and wanted to check it out. It is a local LGBT place. I love to support my community. We went in there and looked at the menu. To sum up, there was a drink I wanted with Belvedere and the house vodka was Absolute. I asked how much extra for Belvedere and the waitress told me there was no upcharge, after confirming with the bar tender. I said OK that's fine, watching the bartender mix my drink she used another vodka besides Belvedere. When I got the check there was an extra $10 up charge for the vodka. And a $1 charge for charity, that I had no clue about it asked if I wanted to donate money.  I asked the waitress why there was an up charge for that vodka. She told me that it's a premium gin. I reminded her that Belvedere is a vodka, not a gin.  The person in charge, came over and said that that, Belvedere it's a premium vodka,  they charge extra for it. I told the person in charge that the waitress said it was no change in the price if I ordered Belvedere, and I didn't even receive the vodka that I ordered.  She took the $10 off the tab and apologise. But I was very upset that I ordered a certain vodka at a price that I was told I was going to get, didn't get it and didn't get the vodka I ordered. I had to argue with the staff to get the price changed and remind them what liquor Belvedere was. At the end they were very apologetic and very courteous to me. On a positive note, I love they use last straw, straws. Paper straws are great to see at a bar. And I'm happy to see them fundraising for a charity, just some information about it would be great.",
