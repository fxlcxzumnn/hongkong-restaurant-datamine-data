          "text": "The ground floor is under construction, which we were not warned of. When we asked the doorman where to check in, he initially ignored us and opened the door for us to leave. We had to make it clear, multiple times, that we had a reservation and needed to check in. He replied in a condescending tone, as if to imply that he either didn\u2019t believe that we had a reservation, or that we didn\u2019t belong in the hotel. When we were finally told that check in was on the 8th floor, and went up to check in, we were told that we had to pay an additional deposit that we were not previously made aware of. Being that we are only in Hong Kong for two days (on business), we did not bring a lot of cash. We paid for the flight, hotel, and additional necessities before arriving so that everything would already be taken care of and hassle free. Any money we have with us is for transportation, food, and fees related to our business. This means that we had to use our business money to pay the deposit, leaving us with insufficient funds for our business needs. When we tried to explain our dilemma to the desk staff, they just nodded their head and brushed it off, making it very clear that they simply don\u2019t care. Now, we are finally to our room and we discover that several lights and outlets do not work. Additionally, there are no outlet adapters in the room and, thanks to the unexpected deposit, we do not have spare cash available to buy an adapter. We also noticed that the room is painfully cold. We tried to turn on the heat, but it does not work. We called the front desk and they told us that the heater for the room does not work. They actually told us that we will need to use a space heater... We payed quite a bit extra for a 4 star hotel as we assumed it would be a much nicer, more pleasant experience. So far, though, it seems to have been a mistake.\n\n*EDIT*\nIt has now been nearly a month since we stayed in this hotel, and they have still never refunded our deposit. You know, the one that they assured us would be refunded the moment we checked out... yeah, that one.
