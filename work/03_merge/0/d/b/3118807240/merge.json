          "text": "To be fair I feel 3.5 stars is more appropriate but there is no \"half\" option so I'm going to be slightly harsh and go with 3 stars. The two of us visited Test Kitchen just this Friday. It's an interesting concept and one that I appreciate. It's an opportunity for any chef to use the space to display their culinary skills! As a result food will always change and may be potentially a little inconsistent. The place has an industrial chic vibe and its setup is part of an old building that is having some life breathed back into it. Great concept and aesthetically quite appealing but just one thing really bugged me that night. We were seated at the large communal table on the ground floor, right in the middle of two groups of four. Due to the high ceilings and plentiful concrete around us, there was no sound insulation at all. Voices bounced from all corners. In some restaurants, they can get away with it where patrons are sitting closer but here the communal table is quite wide so it is hard to carry out a conversation without raising your voice or waiting for a pause from your stranger neighbour \ud83d\ude44. As a party of two, perhaps placing us at the end of the table may have been slightly better. Or if there were more couple bookings, perhaps sitting side by side makes more sense. It is worth checking out but I would be very conscious about the seating next time. Perhaps better if you can just take the entire table with a larger booking. I did notice that the table on the second floor didn't suffer as much with the acoustics. I think there was a third floor too but did not go up to see. As for the food that night, $1000pp all in for 3 starters, two mains (fish, beef), sides and a dessert. Plenty to eat and food was quite good. Service was generally on the better side. Staff was friendly and attentive enough. Had the setup been improved it would have been quite a spot on night. A little disappointing overall. I think some tweaking can go a long way. If there is another interesting chef in the future I might try again but highly unlikely a choice for date night!",

I did notice that the table on the second floor didn't suffer as much with the acoustics. I think there was a third floor too but did not go up to see. As for the food that night, $1000pp all in for 3 starters, two mains (fish, beef), sides and a dessert. Plenty to eat and food was quite good. Service was generally on the better side. Staff was friendly and attentive enough. Had the setup been improved it would have been quite a spot on night. A little disappointing overall. I think some tweaking can go a long way. If there is another interesting chef in the future I might try again but highly unlikely a choice for date night!",
