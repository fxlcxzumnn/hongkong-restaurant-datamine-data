What surprise me this time when I ordered fish n chips was the best one I ever had (except London's Sea Shell Of Lisson Grove). It was freshly made. Fish was so crispy and juicy inside. Not salty but oily. Cannot complaint!\nMy recent experience dinning there I had ordered steak and pork chop for a Friday dinner. Steak I requested medium but finally a bit over. Pork chop was perfect!\nLast Friday I was there for dinner we ordered pork chop in thick cut and fish (forget if it is sea bass) very tasty and keep high quality as usual.",

Food was above average like the other branch in Festival Walk that I go more often.  They share the same lunch menu which offers a variety of decently good food (except the chicken burger I tried the other time).  The cheese beef burger I had today was satisfying.  What made me uncomfortable was the open kitchen.  You have to be very confident about yourself before you open up the sacred place to the eyes of public.  They sure got the confidence but for no obvious reason.  I saw things in a simple way.  In their kitchen there were two types of guys: those who wore gloves and those who didn\u2019t.  Amazingly those who did never touched any food with their gloved hands.  Those without gloves had their hands in constant contact with food, and all other stuff.  Just wonder what the gloves were for.",

Not salty but oily. Cannot complaint!\nMy recent experience dinning there I had ordered steak and pork chop for a Friday dinner. Steak I requested medium but finally a bit over. Pork chop was perfect!\nLast Friday I was there for dinner we ordered pork chop in thick cut and fish (forget if it is sea bass) very tasty and keep high quality as usual.",

Food was above average like the other branch in Festival Walk that I go more often.  They share the same lunch menu which offers a variety of decently good food (except the chicken burger I tried the other time).  The cheese beef burger I had today was satisfying.  What made me uncomfortable was the open kitchen.  You have to be very confident about yourself before you open up the sacred place to the eyes of public.  They sure got the confidence but for no obvious reason.  I saw things in a simple way.  In their kitchen there were two types of guys: those who wore gloves and those who didn\u2019t.  Amazingly those who did never touched any food with their gloved hands.  Those without gloves had their hands in constant contact with food, and all other stuff.  Just wonder what the gloves were for.",

Food was above average like the other branch in Festival Walk that I go more often.  They share the same lunch menu which offers a variety of decently good food (except the chicken burger I tried the other time).  The cheese beef burger I had today was satisfying.  What made me uncomfortable was the open kitchen.  You have to be very confident about yourself before you open up the sacred place to the eyes of public.  They sure got the confidence but for no obvious reason.  I saw things in a simple way.  In their kitchen there were two types of guys: those who wore gloves and those who didn\u2019t.  Amazingly those who did never touched any food with their gloved hands.  Those without gloves had their hands in constant contact with food, and all other stuff.  Just wonder what the gloves were for.",

Not salty but oily. Cannot complaint!\nMy recent experience dinning there I had ordered steak and pork chop for a Friday dinner. Steak I requested medium but finally a bit over. Pork chop was perfect!\nLast Friday I was there for dinner we ordered pork chop in thick cut and fish (forget if it is sea bass) very tasty and keep high quality as usual.",

Food was above average like the other branch in Festival Walk that I go more often.  They share the same lunch menu which offers a variety of decently good food (except the chicken burger I tried the other time).  The cheese beef burger I had today was satisfying.  What made me uncomfortable was the open kitchen.  You have to be very confident about yourself before you open up the sacred place to the eyes of public.  They sure got the confidence but for no obvious reason.  I saw things in a simple way.  In their kitchen there were two types of guys: those who wore gloves and those who didn\u2019t.  Amazingly those who did never touched any food with their gloved hands.  Those without gloves had their hands in constant contact with food, and all other stuff.  Just wonder what the gloves were for.",
