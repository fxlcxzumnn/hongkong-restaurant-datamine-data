          "text": "Coffee was good but being asked to leave wasn\u2019t. \n\nI visited with an elderly relative who wasn\u2019t feeling too good but needed a place to rest and I ordered a coffee.\nBeware there is an unwritten rule that every person that enters must make a purchase. This wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if I hadn\u2019t already made a purchase but I had. When the drink was brought to the table my relative was asked to make a purchase. \n\nWhen I asked to see the sign or why it wasn\u2019t written in the menu I was told it was \u201c..only a spoken rule.\u201d \nI\u2019d ordered a coffee and was told if I don\u2019t order something for the person I was with that the \u201ccameras upstairs will see that you didn\u2019t order anything\u201d. There was another couple in the cafe at the time who only ordered one drink, but somehow they were okay to do so! If it was obvious from the beginning that everyone needs to order 1 thing I wouldn\u2019t have even set foot in the cafe. \n\nI asked to speak to the manager who arrived over an hour later, and treated me with suspicion from the get go. I tried to explain but he wasn\u2019t listening and became angry and loud. So much so that I asked to talk downstairs away from other customers. (To save his face not mine). The barista had perhaps told him that I had refused to order and so the manager didn\u2019t even believe that I had ordered a anything. The coffee cup was still at the table, in plain sight. \n\nWhen suggesting that there should be a sign mentioning the fact that everyone needs to order something I was shouted down and told to \u201ccut the crap\u201d by the manager. No problem to order something if the staff were reasonable and courteous, but being shouted at in front of the whole cafe and being told to leave because of their unfair business practice is simply astonishing. Abysmal experience. \n\nAt least the barista said sorry as we were leaving!\n\nMuch more I could say but...\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about trying a cafe that isn\u2019t a large chain in this area, you\u2019re better off going elsewhere.",

              "text": "Coffee was good but being asked to leave wasn\u2019t. \n\nI visited with an elderly relative who wasn\u2019t feeling too good but needed a place to rest and I ordered a coffee.\nBeware there is an unwritten rule that every person that enters must make a purchase. This wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if I hadn\u2019t already made a purchase but I had. When the drink was brought to the table my relative was asked to make a purchase. \n\nWhen I asked to see the sign or why it wasn\u2019t written in the menu I was told it was \u201c..only a spoken rule.\u201d \nI\u2019d ordered a coffee and was told if I don\u2019t order something for the person I was with that the \u201ccameras upstairs will see that you didn\u2019t order anything\u201d. There was another couple in the cafe at the time who only ordered one drink, but somehow they were okay to do so! If it was obvious from the beginning that everyone needs to order 1 thing I wouldn\u2019t have even set foot in the cafe. \n\nI asked to speak to the manager who arrived over an hour later, and treated me with suspicion from the get go. I tried to explain but he wasn\u2019t listening and became angry and loud. So much so that I asked to talk downstairs away from other customers. (To save his face not mine). The barista had perhaps told him that I had refused to order and so the manager didn\u2019t even believe that I had ordered a anything. The coffee cup was still at the table, in plain sight. \n\nWhen suggesting that there should be a sign mentioning the fact that everyone needs to order something I was shouted down and told to \u201ccut the crap\u201d by the manager. No problem to order something if the staff were reasonable and courteous, but being shouted at in front of the whole cafe and being told to leave because of their unfair business practice is simply astonishing. Abysmal experience. \n\nAt least the barista said sorry as we were leaving!\n\nMuch more I could say but...\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about trying a cafe that isn\u2019t a large chain in this area, you\u2019re better off going elsewhere.",

This wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if I hadn\u2019t already made a purchase but I had. When the drink was brought to the table my relative was asked to make a purchase. \n\nWhen I asked to see the sign or why it wasn\u2019t written in the menu I was told it was \u201c..only a spoken rule.\u201d \nI\u2019d ordered a coffee and was told if I don\u2019t order something for the person I was with that the \u201ccameras upstairs will see that you didn\u2019t order anything\u201d. There was another couple in the cafe at the time who only ordered one drink, but somehow they were okay to do so! If it was obvious from the beginning that everyone needs to order 1 thing I wouldn\u2019t have even set foot in the cafe. \n\nI asked to speak to the manager who arrived over an hour later, and treated me with suspicion from the get go. I tried to explain but he wasn\u2019t listening and became angry and loud. So much so that I asked to talk downstairs away from other customers. (To save his face not mine). The barista had perhaps told him that I had refused to order and so the manager didn\u2019t even believe that I had ordered a anything. The coffee cup was still at the table, in plain sight. \n\nWhen suggesting that there should be a sign mentioning the fact that everyone needs to order something I was shouted down and told to \u201ccut the crap\u201d by the manager. No problem to order something if the staff were reasonable and courteous, but being shouted at in front of the whole cafe and being told to leave because of their unfair business practice is simply astonishing. Abysmal experience. \n\nAt least the barista said sorry as we were leaving!\n\nMuch more I could say but...\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about trying a cafe that isn\u2019t a large chain in this area, you\u2019re better off going elsewhere.",

This wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if I hadn\u2019t already made a purchase but I had. When the drink was brought to the table my relative was asked to make a purchase. \n\nWhen I asked to see the sign or why it wasn\u2019t written in the menu I was told it was \u201c..only a spoken rule.\u201d \nI\u2019d ordered a coffee and was told if I don\u2019t order something for the person I was with that the \u201ccameras upstairs will see that you didn\u2019t order anything\u201d. There was another couple in the cafe at the time who only ordered one drink, but somehow they were okay to do so! If it was obvious from the beginning that everyone needs to order 1 thing I wouldn\u2019t have even set foot in the cafe. \n\nI asked to speak to the manager who arrived over an hour later, and treated me with suspicion from the get go. I tried to explain but he wasn\u2019t listening and became angry and loud. So much so that I asked to talk downstairs away from other customers. (To save his face not mine). The barista had perhaps told him that I had refused to order and so the manager didn\u2019t even believe that I had ordered a anything. The coffee cup was still at the table, in plain sight. \n\nWhen suggesting that there should be a sign mentioning the fact that everyone needs to order something I was shouted down and told to \u201ccut the crap\u201d by the manager. No problem to order something if the staff were reasonable and courteous, but being shouted at in front of the whole cafe and being told to leave because of their unfair business practice is simply astonishing. Abysmal experience. \n\nAt least the barista said sorry as we were leaving!\n\nMuch more I could say but...\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about trying a cafe that isn\u2019t a large chain in this area, you\u2019re better off going elsewhere.",
